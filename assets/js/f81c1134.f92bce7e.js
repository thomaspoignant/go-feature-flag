Managing API keys is crucial for security, but needing a restart for each change led to unnecessary downtime and interruptions.  \\nWith this new feature, you can now update, rotate, and manage API keys on the fly\u2014your relay proxy keeps running, and requests are served continuously, with no need for restarts.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## \ud83e\udd14 The Challenge: API Key Management\\n\\nAPI keys are essential for securing access to your GO Feature Flag relay proxy. However, managing them has always been challenging:\\n\\n- **Key rotation** required service restarts, causing downtime\\n- **Adding new keys** meant taking the service offline\\n- **Removing compromised keys** couldn\'t be done immediately\\n- **No flexibility** to respond quickly to security incidents\\n\\nThese limitations made it difficult to follow security best practices like regular key rotation and immediate response to security threats.\\n\\n## \u2728 Introducing Runtime API Key Updates\\n\\nGO Feature Flag starting `v1.50.0` supports **updating API keys at runtime** without requiring a restart of the relay proxy.  \\nThis feature works in both **default mode** and **flagset mode**, giving you the flexibility to manage keys dynamically.\\n\\n:::info\\nThis feature is available starting from GO Feature Flag `v1.50.0` and above.\\n:::\\n\\n### Key Benefits\\n\\n- \u2705 **Zero Downtime**: Update keys without interrupting service\\n- \u2705 **Immediate Response**: Remove compromised keys instantly\\n- \u2705 **Easy Rotation**: Rotate keys as soon as you change your configuration file\\n- \u2705 **Flexible Management**: Add, remove, or update keys as needed\\n- \u2705 **Automatic Detection**: Changes are detected and applied automatically\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 How It Works\\n\\nThe relay proxy continuously monitors your configuration file for changes. When it detects updates to API keys, it:\\n\\n1. **Validates** the new configuration _(if invalid your new configuration will be ignored)_\\n2. **Updates** the internal API key mappings\\n3. **Applies** changes immediately\\n4. **Continues** serving requests without interruption\\n\\nAll of this happens automatically in the background, with no manual intervention required.\\n\\n## \u2699\ufe0f Configuration Requirements\\n\\n### Default Mode\\n\\nIn default mode, **only API keys can be updated at runtime**:\\n- \u2705 `authorizedKeys.evaluation`\\n- \u2705 `authorizedKeys.admin`\\n- \u274c All other configuration changes are ignored\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udcdd Usage Example\\n\\n```yaml title=\\"goff-proxy.yaml\\"\\n# Initial configuration\\nauthorizedKeys:\\n  evaluation:\\n    - \\"key-1\\"\\n    - \\"key-2\\"\\n  admin:\\n    - \\"admin-key-1\\"\\n\\n# Updated configuration (runtime update - no restart needed!)\\nauthorizedKeys:\\n  evaluation:\\n    - \\"key-1\\"\\n    - \\"key-2\\"\\n    - \\"key-3\\"  # \u2705 New key added\\n    - \\"key-4\\"  # \u2705 Another new key\\n  admin:\\n    - \\"admin-key-1\\"\\n    - \\"admin-key-2\\"  # \u2705 New admin key added\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Flagset Mode\\n\\nIn flagset mode:\\n- \u2705 API keys for each flag set can be updated\\n- \u2705 Flag sets must have a `name` configured\\n- \u274c Other flagset configuration changes are not supported\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udcdd Usage Example\\n\\n```yaml title=\\"goff-proxy.yaml\\"\\nflagSets:\\n  - name: team-a  # \u2705 Name is required for runtime updates\\n    apiKeys:\\n      - \\"team-a-key-1\\"\\n      - \\"team-a-key-2\\"  # \u2705 Can add new keys at runtime\\n    retrievers:\\n      - kind: file\\n        path: /flags/team-a-flags.yaml\\n\\n  - name: team-b\\n    apiKeys:\\n      - \\"team-b-key-1\\"\\n      # \u2705 Can remove keys at runtime by removing them from the config\\n    retrievers:\\n      - kind: s3\\n        bucket: team-b-flags\\n```\\n\\n:::warning\\n**Important**: For flagset mode, your flag sets **must have a `name` configured** for runtime updates to work.  \\nWithout a name (or if you use `default` as the name), runtime updates won\'t be possible since we are not able to target which flagset has changed.\\n:::\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Real-World Use Cases\\n\\n### Use Case 1: Multi-Tenant Key Management\\n\\n**Scenario**: Managing API keys for multiple customers in flagset mode.\\n\\n**Solution**: Update keys for individual flag sets independently. Each customer\'s keys can be managed separately without affecting others.\\n\\n### Use Case 2: Scheduled Key Rotation\\n\\n**Scenario**: Your security policy requires rotating API keys every 90 days.\\n\\n**Solution**: Update the configuration file with new keys, keep old keys temporarily, migrate clients, then remove old keys\u2014all without downtime.\\n\\n### Use Case 3: Team Onboarding\\n\\n**Scenario**: A new team needs access to a flag set.\\n\\n**Solution**: Simply add their API key to the flag set configuration.

Different teams need their own flags, environments require separate configurations, and multi-tenant applications demand isolated flag management. That\'s exactly what Flag Sets are designed to solve.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## \ud83e\udd14 What Are Flag Sets?\\n\\n---\\n\\nFlag Sets are a powerful organizational feature in GO Feature Flag that allows you to group related feature flags into separate, isolated collections. Each flag set operates independently with its own:\\n\\n- **Configuration**: Retrievers, exporters, and notifiers\\n- **API Keys**: Secure access control with dedicated authentication\\n- **Flag Management**: Complete isolation from other flag sets\\n- **Data Tracking**: Separate evaluation data and analytics\\n\\nThink of flag sets as **\\"virtual feature flag environments\\"** within your single GO Feature Flag relay proxy instance.  \\nThey provide the organizational benefits of multiple instances while maintaining the simplicity of a single deployment.\\n\\n## \u2728 What are the benefits of flag sets?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### \ud83c\udfe2 **Team Isolation**\\n\\nIn modern software development, different teams often need to manage their own feature flags independently. With flag sets, you can:\\n\\n- **Team A**: Manage application A feature flags: `new-navigation`, `dark-mode`, `responsive-design`.\\n- **Team B**: Manage application A feature flags: `new-payment-api`, `caching-strategy`, `rate-limiting`, `dark-mode`.\\n- ...\\n\\nEach team gets their own isolated environment without interfering with others.\\n\\n- You can have the same feature flag name with a different configuration.\\n- Team A cannot access to Team B feature flags.\\n- Each flag set can have a dedicated exporter.\\n- Each flag set can notify flag changes in a different place.\\n\\n### \ud83c\udfd8\ufe0f **Multi-Tenant Applications**\\n\\nFor applications serving multiple customers or organizations, flag sets provide perfect isolation:\\n\\n- Each customer gets their own flag set.\\n- No risk of flag name collisions between customers.\\n- Isolated configurations and data tracking.\\n- Secure access control per customer.\\n- Routing to the flag set is based on API Keys.\\n\\n## \u2699\ufe0f How Flag Sets Work\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Configuration Structure\\n\\nFlag sets are configured in your relay proxy configuration file, instead of defining your configuration on top level of the file we have introduce a new field called flagset.\\n\\nIn each flag set you can configure his behavior like in this example:\\n\\n```yaml\\nserver:\\n  mode: http\\n  port: 1031\\nflagsets:\\n  - name: team-a\\n    apiKeys:\\n      - \'team-a-api-key-1\'\\n      - \'team-a-api-key-2\'\\n    retrievers:\\n      - kind: file\\n        path: /flags/team-a-flags.yaml\\n    exporters:\\n      - kind: s3\\n        bucket: team-a-evaluations\\n    notifiers:\\n      - kind: slack\\n        webhookUrl: \'https://hooks.slack.com/services/team-a-webhook\'\\n\\n  - name: team-b\\n    apiKeys:\\n      - \'team-b-api-key\'\\n    retrievers:\\n      - kind: github\\n        repository: my-org/team-b-flags\\n        path: flags.yaml\\n    exporters:\\n      - kind: kafka\\n        topic: team-b-evaluations\\n    notifiers:\\n      - kind: discord\\n        webhookUrl: \'https://discord.com/api/webhooks/team-b-webhook\'\\n\\n  - name: team-c\\n    apiKeys:\\n      - \'team-c-api-key\'\\n    retrievers:\\n      - kind: s3\\n        bucket: team-b-feature-flags\\n        item: flags.yaml\\n    exporters:\\n      - kind: file\\n        outputDir: /logs/team-c-evaluations\\n    pollingInterval: 1000\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, you are able to configure every flag sets differently.\\n\\n:::tip\\nAlways provide a **`name`** for your flag sets. This enables runtime API key updates without requiring a restart of the relay proxy.\\nIf you omit the name (or use `default` as the name), a UUID will be generated automatically and you won\'t be able to update API keys at runtime.\\n:::\\n\\n### API Key-Based Routing\\n\\nThe magic of flag sets lies in their API key-based routing system:\\n\\n1. **Extract API Key**: The relay proxy extracts the API key from the `X-API-Key` header.\\n1. **Find Flag Set**: It looks up which flag set is associated with that API key.\\n1. **Route Request**: The evaluation request is routed to that specific flag set.\\n1. **Return Result**: The evaluation result comes from that flag set\'s flags.\\n\\nThis means you can have identical flag names across different flag sets without any conflicts \u2728.\\n\\n### OpenFeature Provider Integration\\n\\nUsing flag sets in your applications is straightforward. You simply initialize your providers with the correct API key.  \\nAll the providers have a way to pass the API Key to use, based on this one the relay proxy will route the request to the correct flag set.\\n\\n## Key Benefits of using flag sets\\n\\n---\\n\\n### \ud83d\udd12 **Complete Isolation**\\n\\n- No inheritance between flag sets\\n- Identical flag names can exist across different sets\\n- Independent configurations and data tracking\\n\\n### \ud83d\udd11 **Secure Access Control**\\n\\n- API key-based authentication for each flag set\\n- Multiple API keys per flag set for flexibility\\n- No cross-contamination between teams or customers\\n- **Runtime API key updates**: Update, add, or rotate API keys without restarting the relay proxy\\n\\n### \ud83c\udfaf **Flexible Configuration**\\n\\n- Each flag set can have its own retrievers, exporters, and notifiers\\n- Independent polling intervals and file formats\\n- Custom notification channels per team\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcca **Separate Analytics**\\n\\n- Evaluation data is tracked separately per flag set\\n- Independent export configurations\\n- Team-specific monitoring and alerting\\n\\n## Migration Guide\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you\'re currently using a single GO Feature Flag configuration, migrating to flag sets is straightforward:\\n\\n### Option 1: Gradual Migration\\n\\n1. Ensure that all your providers are using API Keys to connect to GO Feature Flag.\\n2. Create a flag set and move your actual configuration inside it.\\n3. Associate your API Keys to the flag set.\\n4. Create extra flag sets and move flags over them.\\n5. Change the API Key used in your provider to point to the right flag set.\\n\\n### Option 2: Full Migration\\n\\n1. Create flag sets for each team or purpose.\\n2. Move all flags to appropriate flag sets.\\n3. Update all applications with new API keys.\\n4. Remove the old single configuration.\\n\\n## Get Started Today\\n\\nFlag Sets are available now in GO Feature Flag!

We\'ll explore how it works and how you can leverage it to enrich your evaluation events with valuable static information.\\n\\n## What is Exporter Metadata?\\nExporter metadata is an object you can configure when initializing your GO Feature Flag provider for OpenFeature.\\n\\nIt allows you to specify a set of static information that you want to consistently include with all your evaluation events.\\nA good example of information you might include in exporter metadata is the environment in which your application is running,\\nthe version of the application or anything that helps you when you analyze your evaluation data.\\n\\nThis data is then forwarded to the exporter and incorporated into your feature events as a new field called `metadata`.\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n## Why Use Exporter Metadata?\\n\\nIncluding exporter metadata in your evaluation events offers several advantages:\\n- **Enhanced Context**: By adding static information to your events, you can provide richer context for analysis. This can include details about the environment (e.g., development, staging, production), the application version, or any other relevant data that sheds light on feature usage patterns.\\n- **Improved Observability**: With exporter metadata, you gain a more comprehensive view of feature evaluation across different contexts. This can be particularly useful for debugging purposes or identifying trends in feature adoption for specific environments or application versions.\\n- **Simplified Data Enrichment**: Exporter metadata eliminates the need to manually inject context information into every evaluation event. This streamlines your code and ensures consistency in the data you collect.\\n\\n## How to Use Exporter Metadata\\n\\nIn all providers that support exporter metadata, you can pass a map of key-value pairs to the `ExporterMetadata` field in the provider\'s configuration.\\nValue can be a `string`, a `bool`, an `int` or a `float64`.\\n\\nThis map will be included in all evaluation events sent to the exporter and added to the `metadata` field by the exporter.\\n\\nHere\'s an example of how you can configure exporter metadata in the Kotlin provider:\\n```kotlin\\nval options =\\n    GoFeatureFlagOptions(\\n        endpoint = \\"https://mygoffserver.com/\\",\\n        exporterMetadata = mapOf(\\"device\\" to \\"Pixel 4\\", \\"appVersion\\" to \\"1.0.0\\")\\n    )\\n\\nval provider = GoFeatureFlagProvider(options)\\n```\\nIn this example, we\'re passing some information that can help to understand the context of the evaluation events such as the device type and the appVersion.\\n\\nWith this configuration, all evaluation events sent to the exporter will include the `metadata` field with the specified key-value pairs.\\nAnd it will look like this:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\"kind\\":\\"feature\\",\\"contextKind\\":\\"user\\",\\"userKey\\":\\"4f433951-4c8c-42b3-9f18-8c9a5ed8e9eb\\",\\"creationDate\\":1737465936,\\"key\\":\\"REDIRECTION\\",\\"variation\\":\\"on\\",\\"value\\":true,\\"default\\":false,\\"version\\":\\"\\",\\"source\\":\\"PROVIDER_CACHE\\", \\"metadata\\": {\\"device\\": \\"Pixel 4\\", \\"appVersion\\":\\"1.0.0\\", \\"openfeature\\": true, \\"provider\\": \\"android\\"}}\\n```\\n\\n## Which Providers Support Exporter Metadata?\\nTo be able to use exporter metadata, you need to use the relay-proxy in version `v1.41.1` or above and as minimum the following version of the providers:\\n- **Kotlin**: `v0.3.0`\\n- **Web**: `v0.2.4`\\n- **Swift**: `v0.3.0`\\n- **Java**: `v0.4.2`\\n- **NodeJS**: `v0.7.5`\\n- **PHP**: `1.1.0`\\n- **Ruby**: `0.1.3`\\n- **Python**: `v0.4.1`\\n- **.NET**: `0.2.1`\\n- **GO**: `v0.2.3`\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nExporter metadata provides a powerful mechanism to enrich your evaluation events with static information in the GO Feature Flag provider for OpenFeature.\\nBy incorporating this functionality, you can gain deeper insights into feature usage patterns and streamline your data collection process.\\n\\nThis blog post has provided a brief introduction to exporter metadata.\\nWe encourage you to experiment with this feature and explore its potential to enhance your feature flag evaluation practices."},{"id":"/2024/10/20/breaking-change-java","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/10/20/breaking-change-java","editUrl":"https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/tree/main/website/blog/2024-10-20-breaking-change-java/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-20-breaking-change-java/index.md","title":"(Java)

Feature Flag and OpenFeature.\\n\\nTo better serve our users\' diverse needs, we\'ve decided to split the previous Go provider into two distinct providers:\\n- [`go-feature-flag`](https://github.com/open-feature/go-sdk-contrib/tree/main/providers/go-feature-flag): For use with the GO Feature Flag relay proxy.\\n- [`go-feature-flag-in-process`](https://github.com/open-feature/go-sdk-contrib/tree/main/providers/go-feature-flag-in-process): For direct integration of GO Feature Flag into your application.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Why the Split?\\n\\nThe decision to create separate providers was driven by several factors:\\n- **Distinct Use Cases:** It\'s uncommon for users to require both the relay proxy and in-process capabilities simultaneously.\\n- **Dependency Management:** The in-process provider introduces additional dependencies, which can complicate integration.\\n- **Maintainability:** Managing two distinct functionalities within a single provider proved challenging.\\n\\nBy separating these functionalities, we\'ve streamlined the integration process and enhanced overall maintainability.\\n\\nWe also use this split to rewrite from scratch the provider to increase the quality of the OpenFeature integration.\\n\\n## Choosing the Right Provider\\n\\nTo select the appropriate provider for your application, consider the following:\\n- [`go-feature-flag`](https://github.com/open-feature/go-sdk-contrib/tree/main/providers/go-feature-flag): Ideal for multi-language environments using the GO Feature Flag relay proxy. This provider offers a lightweight integration with minimal dependencies, ensuring consistency with other language-specific providers.\\n- [`go-feature-flag-in-process`](https://github.com/open-feature/go-sdk-contrib/tree/main/providers/go-feature-flag-in-process): Best suited for Go-only applications that prefer a direct integration without the overhead of a separate service.\\n\\n## Breaking Changes\\nAs you may imagine, this split comes with some breaking changes, but we\'ve done everything possible to limit it as much as possible.\\nPlease be aware of the following breaking changes:\\n\\n- **Existing go-feature-flag users:** If you were previously using the `go-feature-flag` provider with the Go module, you\'ll need to transition to the `go-feature-flag-in-process` provider.\\n- **Configuration Changes:** The `HTTPClient` interface has been removed from the configuration in favor of using the standard `http.Client` _(This should have no impact on the way to pass the http client in the options)_. \\n- **Cache Compatibility:** If you are using the in-memory cache of the provider, ensure your relay proxy is updated to version `1.32.0` or later, if not the cache will not work as expected and you may have an increase on the number of connection to the relay-proxy.\\n\\nWe understand that these changes may require adjustments to your existing setup. We recommend carefully reviewing the updated documentation for both providers to ensure a smooth transition.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nWe encourage you to explore the new providers and leverage the enhanced features they offer. If you encounter any issues or have feedback, please don\'t hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/issues/new/choose).\\n\\nWe\'re committed to providing you with the best possible feature flagging experience."},{"id":"/2024/08/02/feature-flagging-in-the-SDLC","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/08/02/feature-flagging-in-the-SDLC","editUrl":"https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/tree/main/website/blog/2024-08-02-feature-flagging-in-the-SDLC/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-02-feature-flagging-in-the-SDLC/index.md","title":"Feature Flagging in the SDLC","description":"Feature Flagging in the Software Development Lifecycle - Follow the life of a feature flag from birth to retirement.","date":"2024-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openfeature","permalink":"/blog/tags/openfeature"},{"inline":true,"label":"SDLC","permalink":"/blog/tags/sdlc"},{"inline":true,"label":"Slides","permalink":"/blog/tags/slides"},{"inline":true,"label":"Presentation","permalink":"/blog/tags/presentation"}],"readingTime":0.83,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Poignant","title":"Creator of GO Feature Flag","url":"https://github.com/thomaspoignant","imageURL":"https://github.com/thomaspoignant.png","key":"thomaspoignant","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Feature Flagging in the SDLC","description":"Feature Flagging in the Software Development Lifecycle - Follow the life of a feature flag from birth to retirement.","authors":["thomaspoignant"],"tags":["openfeature","SDLC","Slides","Presentation"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Changes to golang OpenFeature Integration","permalink":"/blog/2024/08/14/changes-to-golang-openfeature-integration"},"nextItem":{"title":"GO Feature Flag: Now Powering Your Mobile App Experience","permalink":"/blog/2024/07/25/go-feature-flag-mobile-support"}},"content":"**Thomas** recently delivered a presentation on Feature Flagging in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for OpenFeature.

Traditional release cycles can be lengthy and risky. Feature flags provide a dynamic solution by allowing you to control feature visibility without redeploying your app.\\n\\n**This translates to:**\\n- Faster time-to-market: Experiment with new features and iterate quickly based on user feedback.\\n- Reduced risk: Gradually roll out features to minimize potential issues and impact.\\n- Enhanced control: Turn features on or off in real-time based on user segments or other criteria.\\n\\n## How GO Feature Flag Delivers for Mobile\\n\\nTo bring feature flags to mobile, we\'ve fully embraced the OpenFeature standard.\\n\\n**This means:**\\n- Native support for **iOS** and **Android**: A provider for each platform ensures seamless integration with the OpenFeature SDKs in your mobile app\'s core.\\n- **React Native** compatibility: With the usage of GO Feature Flag web provider and the OpenFeature React SDK you can now manage feature flags within your React Native app using familiar JavaScript syntax.\\n\\n## Diving Deeper into the Tech\\n\\nWhen it comes to client side, on the 3 platforms we are using the OpenFeature static paradigm *(client side SDK)*. What does it means?\\nThe key distinction between the client- and server-side feature flagging is the difference in how often evaluation context changes.\\n\\nWhen on your mobile device, your evaluation context is changing very rarely since the device is linked to a user. Also, in the client, you expect a very low latency to get the value of your flag.\\nBased on this idea, the GO Feature Flag providers will retrieve your set of flags and cache them on the device, so you can evaluate them without any network call.\\n\\nIf you want to read more about the OpenFeature static paradigm, you can read this [article from Pete Hodgson](https://openfeature.dev/blog/catering-to-the-client-side) in the OpenFeature blog.\\n\\n\\nFor those interested in the technical details, let\'s explore how this integration works in this sequence diagram:\\n\\n[![](https://mermaid.ink/img/pako:eNrFVdtO20AQ_ZXV9oEgGUV9aokqpBIuQhUKahBClV829thZsd5x1-tAivj3zl4cJyEE-tQ8Zcdnzpy57T7zDHPgI97A7xZ0BmdSlEZUqWb0q4WxMpO10JaJumaiYdc4kwrcSclMWIn6NRQLh5zUoAsQtjXApmc_vs3M8GQgNVtia5jCTCjHcvja3ce5nLCL6HyhRMluDC5kDubjNCUWxS6mn6DE0vE9LQOZgQotEEPg0HRguADjeBNPM2JXWloplGx8yi5Dl95Fnx57lHb-purATHxHJydIdA3Y7tPgchJdnEdnTWAhVOuDjVFbeLIxQyyIoh4xGQX9gcFbUBcsqP9-c8VuJtNbNsTCQD1cfB5GJxgWFLXZzrxOesexUIpZZCXQELi_c2DeiXUcua-jKIXUjfXfe0ksC5pCBMd6FBJYi1sHy1hk5LoeYo2n6dqjEGtGwOwhQLK50CVEpt1ZjD1aFo6XOiMbJpysQpatiSI9CYUDE4binlpEkJygOmcGqGzN3OuSlI7RNHWZk9uHdUmwfyr3VkGCEXTeFSXOyqrvLgCNkLPsmVQ_d-erum1PHnXxFFGB0HcEgUHKq-WRE5XyhBVCNbAaNBZ0UeaoFhC9eubBQfQ8ONxS7CDQs5DVy47mPdrHoQ203buHKOxrgYbBk6hqdw8V1lHQVJTk1V0L_YWwsXJxPQYaHs_fWa-VfQp78f9xx0jVm3v2wY3aOWdsc9Biw3jCKzCVkDk9Fs_OlHIirSDlhOMz0dC_ZM1-J4wUM0WbSYDnbuJTXhtZCbMco0ITfD9lUHyBr9E9oFyZTh_Kd1CR65byXkceHx9vwJTUsO87jRDdpZuaPCZAXlL9QumL1uJ0qTM-sqaFhLd1Tn2J7-Wm8TyXFg0f-X1KOPjjdXhow8VDfPRI_UKsViiDbTmPp5e_6kKEdw?type=png)](https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNrFVdtO20AQ_ZXV9oEgGUV9aokqpBIuQhUKahBClV829thZsd5x1-tAivj3zl4cJyEE-tQ8Zcdnzpy57T7zDHPgI97A7xZ0BmdSlEZUqWb0q4WxMpO10JaJumaiYdc4kwrcSclMWIn6NRQLh5zUoAsQtjXApmc_vs3M8GQgNVtia5jCTCjHcvja3ce5nLCL6HyhRMluDC5kDubjNCUWxS6mn6DE0vE9LQOZgQotEEPg0HRguADjeBNPM2JXWloplGx8yi5Dl95Fnx57lHb-purATHxHJydIdA3Y7tPgchJdnEdnTWAhVOuDjVFbeLIxQyyIoh4xGQX9gcFbUBcsqP9-c8VuJtNbNsTCQD1cfB5GJxgWFLXZzrxOesexUIpZZCXQELi_c2DeiXUcua-jKIXUjfXfe0ksC5pCBMd6FBJYi1sHy1hk5LoeYo2n6dqjEGtGwOwhQLK50CVEpt1ZjD1aFo6XOiMbJpysQpatiSI9CYUDE4binlpEkJygOmcGqGzN3OuSlI7RNHWZk9uHdUmwfyr3VkGCEXTeFSXOyqrvLgCNkLPsmVQ_d-erum1PHnXxFFGB0HcEgUHKq-WRE5XyhBVCNbAaNBZ0UeaoFhC9eubBQfQ8ONxS7CDQs5DVy47mPdrHoQ203buHKOxrgYbBk6hqdw8V1lHQVJTk1V0L_YWwsXJxPQYaHs_fWa-VfQp78f9xx0jVm3v2wY3aOWdsc9Biw3jCKzCVkDk9Fs_OlHIirSDlhOMz0dC_ZM1-J4wUM0WbSYDnbuJTXhtZCbMco0ITfD9lUHyBr9E9oFyZTh_Kd1CR65byXkceHx9vwJTUsO87jRDdpZuaPCZAXlL9QumL1uJ0qTM-sqaFhLd1Tn2J7-Wm8TyXFg0f-X1KOPjjdXhow8VDfPRI_UKsViiDbTmPp5e_6kKEdw)\\n\\nAs you can see, the provider is keeping all the flags in memory to serve them as fast as possible without any network call.\\n\\n## How to integrate GO Feature Flag into your mobile app?\\n\\nReady to supercharge your mobile app development with GO Feature Flag?

What if a new feature causes unforeseen issues or negatively impacts your users?**\\n\\nThis is where feature flags come to the rescue, offering a safety net that allows you to roll back features immediately without waiting for a deployment. In this blog post, we\'ll explore why feature flags are an essential tool for securing your software releases.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The old way of doing rollbacks\\n\\nIf you are not using feature flags, your release process probably look like this:\\n![classic-RELEASE-process.svg](classic-RELEASE-process.svg)\\n\\n1. You code your new feature.\\n2. Your CI/CD is in charge to put your code in production.\\n3. Your new feature is available to all your users.\\n\\n**BUT what happen if your releases needs to be rollback?**\\n\\n![classic-ROLLBACK-process.svg](classic-ROLLBACK-process.svg)\\n\\nYou will most likely use the same process and go with something like\\n1. Revert your code and push the code.\\n2. Your CI/CD is in charge to put your code in production.\\n3. Your rollback is effective.\\n\\nDon\'t get me wrong this works, and you are probably doing it for years, but here are some problems your may occur while doing it:\\n- You have to identify what was changed and rollback the code to rollback the code associated to your feature.\\n- If you are unlucky, your main branch has changed since your last deployment, so coming back to the previous state may require to rollback more than your feature, and it can impact other teams.\\n- Depending on your deployment pipeline it can take minutes to hours to push your rollback in production.\\n\\n## Secure your release using feature flags\\n### How feature flags can help here?\\nThe main things we try to achieve here is to unlink deploy and release.\\nChanging your release process with feature flags is important if you want to secure your way to release new feature in your application.\\n\\nTo achieve this we will follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Create a dedicated feature flag for this feature. This flag should be independent of other flags and only control the state of this new feature.\\n2. In your application\'s codebase, implement checks that will monitor the state of the flag. This can usually be done with the usage of a `boolean` flag. If the flag is set to \\"**`false`**\\" the code should disable the feature\'s functionality.\\n3. When deploying the feature to production, ensure that the flag is initially set to `false` position for 100% of your users.\\n4. When you are ready to release the new feature, set the feature to `true` position for a part of your users.\\n5. Monitor the feature\'s performance closely during its initial release.\\n![ff-release-process.svg](ff-release-process.svg)\\n\\n### BUT what happen if your releases needs to be rollback?\\n\\nNow that we have a flag for our new feature it makes our life way easier to rollback this new feature, because as you guess we only have to put back the flag to 0% of our users and the feature will not be available anymore. \\n\\n![ff-rollback-process.svg](ff-rollback-process.svg)\\n\\n### How to do this with GO Feature Flag?\\n\\n1. Create a new flag\\n  ```yaml\\n  my-new-feature:\\n    variations:\\n      enabled: true\\n      disabled: false\\n    defaultRule:\\n      percentage:\\n        enabled: 0\\n        disabled: 100\\n  ```\\n  _As you can see the flag `my-new-feature` will be off for all your users._\\n\\n2. Wrap your new feature with the check of the flag\\n  ```go\\n      evalCtx := of.NewEvaluationContext(\\"d45e303a-38c2-11ed-a261-0242ac120002\\")\\n      if client.BooleanValue(ctx, \\"my-new-feature\\", false, evalCtx){\\n        // code of my new feature ...\\n      }\\n  ```\\n  _This example use the OpenFeature GO SDK syntax, but you can do it in any language._ \\n  \\n3. Deploy your code in production.\\n4. When you are ready to release, edit your flag configuration file to add traffic.\\n  ```yaml\\n  my-new-feature:\\n    variations:\\n      enabled: true\\n      disabled: false\\n    defaultRule:\\n      percentage:\\n        enabled: 100\\n        disabled: 0\\n  ```\\n5. \ud83d\udea8 If you find a bug and you want to rollback, just edit the flag configuration file again and your feature will be rollback.\\n  ```yaml\\n  my-new-feature:\\n    variations:\\n      enabled: true\\n      disabled: false\\n    defaultRule:\\n      percentage:\\n        enabled: 0\\n        disabled: 100\\n  ```\\n6. Your feature will be rollback immediately and the good part is that you don\'t even have deployed anything.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn the dynamic world of software engineering, ensuring the security of your releases is paramount.  \\nFeature flags offer a powerful mechanism for immediate rollbacks, reducing the risk associated with introducing new features. \\n\\nBy embracing feature flags, you can respond swiftly to issues, minimize downtime, and make informed decisions based on real-time data.  \\nThe result is a more robust and user-friendly software release process that enhances both the development team\'s confidence and the end-users\' experience. \\n\\nSo, don\'t wait\u2014start incorporating feature flags into your development workflow today and unlock the potential for secure and successful releases."},{"id":"/2023/07/24/nodejs-tutorial","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/24/nodejs-tutorial","editUrl":"https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/tree/main/website/blog/2023-07-24-nodejs-tutorial/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-24-nodejs-tutorial/index.md","title":"Add Feature Flags in your Node.JS application using GO Feature Flag and Open Feature SDK","description":"In this video, we\'ll walk you through the process of implementing feature flags in your Node js applications, allowing you to roll out new features gradually and control their visibility in real-time.","date":"2023-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openfeature","permalink":"/blog/tags/openfeature"},{"inline":true,"label":"nodeJS","permalink":"/blog/tags/node-js"}],"readingTime":2.91,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Poignant","title":"Creator of GO Feature Flag","url":"https://github.com/thomaspoignant","imageURL":"https://github.com/thomaspoignant.png","key":"thomaspoignant","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Add Feature Flags in your Node.JS application using GO Feature Flag and Open Feature SDK","description":"In this video, we\'ll walk you through the process of implementing feature flags in your Node js applications, allowing you to roll out new features gradually and control their visibility in real-time.","authors":["thomaspoignant"],"tags":["openfeature","nodeJS"],"image":"http://gofeatureflag.org/assets/images/banner-819d71b94352213afa22d2b53f376cab.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The Power of Rollbacks","permalink":"/blog/2023/09/12/the-power-of-rollbacks"},"nextItem":{"title":"Enhancing Flag Configuration with Flag Metadata","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/09/flag-metadata"}},"content":"<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"444\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ascFFZqjQAI\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nWelcome to this tutorial on using feature flags in Node js with GO Feature Flag and Open Feature SDKs.\\n\\nIn this video, we\'ll walk you through the process of implementing feature flags in your Node js applications, allowing you to roll out new features gradually and control their visibility in real-time.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Setup GO Feature Flag\\nBefore we proceed with the implementation, it\'s essential to set up GO Feature Flag to efficiently evaluate our flags.\\nTo achieve this, we will create a new file called `goff-proxy.yaml` that will contain the configuration on how to retrieve our feature flags\' configuration file.\\n\\nIn this file, we will first configure where to retrieve the flags and also a polling interval _(here 5000 milliseconds)_.  \\nIt means that GO Feature Flag will read the file every 5 seconds to check if your configuration has changed.\\n\\n```yaml\\nretriever:\\n  kind: github  # type of retriever we are using\\n  repositorySlug: thomaspoignant/demo-goff  # repository we are retrieving\\n  path: flags.yaml  # location of the file in the repository\\npollingInterval: 5000  # Time in milliseconds we wait before trying to check for changes\\n```\\n\\n## Create our first flag\\nTo create our flag we start by using the [GO Feature Flag editor](https://editor.gofeatureflag.org), for our test we will create a flag\\nnamed `my-new-feature` and it will use a type `boolean`.\\n\\n![editor.png](editor.png)\\n\\nWhen it is ready you can  copy/paste the flag definition and commit it in GitHub.\\n\\n## Start GO Feature Flag\\nWe will now start GO Feature Flag, for this we gonna use the docker image.\\n\\n```shell\\ndocker run -p 1031:1031 -e RETRIEVER_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN -v $(pwd):/goff thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag\\n```\\n\\nWith this command we launch GO Feature Flag on the port 1031 and with the configuration file we just created, you can also see that we provide a GitHub Token, this is to avoid being rate limited by the Github API.\\n\\n![terminal.png](terminal.png)\\n\\nGO Feature Flag is now started, and we can see that our flag is loaded.\\n\\n## Create Node.JS application using OpenFeature\\nNow let\'s start to create our Node JS application.\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { GoFeatureFlagProvider } from \\"@openfeature/go-feature-flag-provider\\"\\nimport { EvaluationContext, OpenFeature } from \\"@openfeature/js-sdk\\"\\n\\nasync function main(){\\n  // We start by creating an instance of the Go Feature Flag Provider\\n  // We are just setting the endpoint to connect to our instance of GO Feature Flag\\n  const provider = new GoFeatureFlagProvider({\\n     endpoint: \'http://localhost:1031\'\\n  })\\n\\n  // We associate the provider to the SDK\\n  // It means that now when we call OpenFeature it will rely on GO Feature Flag as a backend.\\n  OpenFeature.setProvider(provider)\\n  \\n  // We need to ask for a client to evaluate the flags.\\n  const client = OpenFeature.getClient()\\n\\n  // We create a context for our evaluation.\\n  const ctx: EvaluationContext = {\\n     targetingKey: \'aae1cb41-c3cb-4753-a117-031ddc958f82\'\\n  }\\n\\n  // We evaluate the flag.\\n  const myNewFeature = await client.getBooleanValue(\\"my-new-feature\\", false, ctx)\\n\\n  if (myNewFeature) {\\n    // the new feature is available\\n  } else {\\n    // apply the old feature\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nmain()\\n```\\n\\nYou are now ready to use GO Feature Flag in your application.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this tutorial we\'ve seen how simple it is to use GO Feature Flag in your Node.JS application using the OpenFeature SDK.\\n\\nI encourage you to read our documentation to see all the amazing possibility that you will have.\\n\\nAnd please provide us [feedbacks](mailto:contact@gofeatureflag.org) on how we can make your experience even better."},{"id":"/2023/06/09/flag-metadata","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/06/09/flag-metadata","editUrl":"https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/tree/main/website/blog/2023-06-09-flag-metadata/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-09-flag-metadata/index.mdx","title":"Enhancing Flag Configuration with Flag Metadata","description":"Empowering developers to attach additional information directly to flag configurations for enhanced management and code efficiency.","date":"2023-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"feature flag","permalink":"/blog/tags/feature-flag"},{"inline":true,"label":"relay-proxy","permalink":"/blog/tags/relay-proxy"},{"inline":true,"label":"metadata","permalink":"/blog/tags/metadata"}],"readingTime":2.33,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Poignant","title":"Creator of GO Feature Flag","url":"https://github.com/thomaspoignant","imageURL":"https://github.com/thomaspoignant.png","key":"thomaspoignant","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Enhancing Flag Configuration with Flag Metadata","description":"Empowering developers to attach additional information directly to flag configurations for enhanced management and code efficiency.","authors":["thomaspoignant"],"tags":["feature flag","relay-proxy","metadata"],"image":"http://gofeatureflag.org/assets/images/3819075-0f37048ae26af73edc44747cd03d9eb7.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Add Feature Flags in your Node.JS application using GO Feature Flag and Open Feature SDK","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/24/nodejs-tutorial"},"nextItem":{"title":"Limiting Access to the relay proxy with API Keys","permalink":"/blog/2023/04/12/relay_proxy_api_keys"}},"content":"![metadata](3819075.png)\\n\\nIn the ever-evolving world of software development, feature flag solutions have become instrumental in enabling continuous integration and deployment.\\nThese solutions allow developers to toggle features on and off without deploying new code, providing flexibility and control over feature releases.\\n\\nBut sometimes you need to give context about your flag, is it linked to an issue?

deploying code changes.\\nIt allows you to test and roll out new features to your users gradually, and to monitor the performance of your code in real-time.\\n\\nWith the recent release of version `v1.7.0`, GO Feature Flag Relay Proxy introduces a new feature that enhances the\\nsecurity of your feature flag evaluations.\\nThis new feature allows you to control who can access your relay proxy by configuring API Keys.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Limiting Access with API Keys\\n\\nWith the release of GO Feature Flag Relay Proxy version `v1.7.0`, you can now limit access to the relay proxy by configuring API Keys.\\nThis feature allows you to restrict access to only known clients, adding an additional layer of security to your feature flag evaluations.\\n\\nTo enable this feature, you need to add a list of API Keys to your configuration.\\nOnly requests with these API Keys will be accepted. This means that any requests without a valid API Key will be rejected.\\n\\nIn your **relay proxy** configuration file it will look like this:\\n```yaml\\n# ...\\n# List of authorized API keys.\\n# Each request will need to provide one of authorized key inside a X-API-Key header with format` X-API-Key: <api-key>`.\\n# There will be no authorization when this config is not configured.\\napiKeys:\\n  - 6147795c-4438-44f1-8ab2-18cb3fa9591f # apiKey for client 1\\n  - 3e3fb534-c8fd-42e9-8f2e-c80276b1685c # apiKey for client 2\\n  - 6603f9f8-2871-4149-81e8-8a362a8ae266 # apiKey for client 3\\n  - 0fc30ffe-b9bc-4398-a9f1-6f8b8486e8ce # apiKey for client 4\\n  - 500d222e-2654-41a4-bd31-e24a629cb78a # apiKey for client 5\\n\\n# ...\\n```\\n\\n## Using Client API Keys with Openfeature Providers\\n\\nIf you are using Open Feature and our providers, we have updated them to handle the `apiKey` for you.\\nYou can now specify your `apiKey` directly when you are initializing your provider. This will authenticate every request\\nto the relay proxy with this apiKey.\\n\\nTo use this feature, you need to specify the client API Key in your Open Feature provider initialization.\\nThis can be done by adding the `apiKey` like this:\\n\\n<Tabs groupId=\\"code\\">\\n      <TabItem value=\\"go\\" label=\\"GO\\">\\n\\n```go\\nprovider, err :=

tool for software development, allowing for more flexible and adaptable development processes.\\n\\nHowever, to get the most out of feature flags, it\'s important to follow some best practices to ensure they are used effectively and efficiently.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83e\udd37 Keep flags simple and scoped\\nOne of the most important best practices for feature flags is to keep them **simple** and **scoped**.\\n\\nThis means avoiding overly complex flags that do too much, and instead using small, targeted flags that can be easily managed and maintained.\\nKeeping flags simple and scoped helps to avoid confusion and reduces the risk of bugs or other issues.\\n\\n## \u23f0 Avoid using flags as a long-term solution\\nAnother important best practice is to avoid using feature flags as a long-term solution.\\n\\nFeature flags should be used as a temporary measure to test new features or functionality, and then removed once the feature is fully tested and released.\\n\\nLeaving flags in place for too long can lead to code bloat and confusion, making it harder to maintain and update your codebase.\\n\\n## \ud83e\uddea Test and monitor flags\\nTesting and monitoring flags is essential to ensuring they are working as intended.\\n\\nThis means setting up a testing environment where you can test flags in a controlled environment, as well as monitoring\\nthe usage of flags in production to ensure they are not causing any issues.\\n\\nBy testing and monitoring flags, you can catch any issues early and avoid potential problems down the line.\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Centralize your feature flags in a single location\\n\\nCentralize your feature flags in a single location, such as a feature flag management system _(GO Feature Flag is here to help you)_, to make it easier to\\nmanage and track them across different applications and environments.\\n\\nThis can help avoid conflicts and inconsistencies, improve collaboration among teams, and reduce the risk of introducing bugs or unintended consequences.\\n\\nIt also helps to use the same flag for multiple applications and to be able to act on a distributed systems.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcdd Document flags and their purpose\\nDocumenting flags and their purpose is another best practice that can help to avoid confusion and ensure that everyone on the team is on the same page.\\n\\nThis means providing clear documentation for each flag, including its purpose, when it should be used, and any relevant notes or instructions.\\nThis can help to prevent misunderstandings and ensure that flags are used correctly.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd28Use feature flags in combination with other tools\\nFinally, it\'s important to remember that feature flags are just one tool in your development toolbox.\\n\\nTo get the most out of feature flags, it\'s important to use them in combination with other tools, such as testing\\nframeworks, monitoring tools, CI/CD, and version control systems.\\n\\nBy using feature flags in combination with other tools, you can create a more comprehensive and effective development process.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Conclusion\\nFollowing these best practices can help to ensure that your feature flags are used effectively and efficiently, allowing you to take full advantage of the benefits they offer.\\n\\nBy keeping flags simple and scoped, avoiding long-term use, testing and monitoring flags, documenting flags and their purpose, and using feature flags in combination with other tools, you can create a more flexible and adaptable development process that can help you to stay ahead of the competition.\\n\\n<center>\\n  <Link to={\'/docs\'} >\\n    <button className=\\"pushy__btn pushy__btn--md pushy__btn--black\\">\\n      Getting started

This format is solving all the limitation we had with the version `v0.x.x` of **GO Feature Flag**.\\n\\n### Migrate from v0.x.x to v1.x.x\\n\\nFirst of all you should know that all flags from the version `v0.x.x` are still compatible with this new version of **GO Feature Flag**. We made it possible to reduce the disagreement to have to convert all your flag directly.\\n\\n**BUT** we encourage you to migrate your flag to the new version and for this we have created a tool called `go-feature-flag-migration-cli` to convert flags in `v0.x.x` format to `v1.0.0` format.\\n\\nThe easiest way to use it is probably to use our docker image like this:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker run \\\\\\n  -v $(pwd)/your/configuration_folder:/config \\\\\\n  thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag-migration-cli:latest \\\\\\n  --input-format=yaml \\\\\\n  --input-file=/config/my-go-feature-flag-config-v0.x.x.yaml \\\\\\n  --output-format=yaml \\\\\\n  --output-file=/config/my-go-feature-flag-config-v1.x.x.yaml\\n```\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nWe use the opportunity of the `v1.0.0` to revamp our documentation and to highlight how you can use **GO Feature Flag** in 2 different modes.\\n\\n- **The GO module**, this is where we started and this is the core of what we propose. In the documentation you will find all the information on how to use the module into your GO project.\\n- Using **Open-Feature**, the new open-source vendor agnostic standard for feature flags. You can use the `relay-proxy` our server component that allows to use **GO Feature Flag** with multiple languages *(for now we support `javascript`, `typescript`, `java`, `GO` and `.Net`)*. In the documentation you will find how to use the **GO Feature Flag providers** in combination with the **Open Feature SDKs**.\\n\\n## Flag Editor\\n\\nOur old flag editor was not compatible anymore with the new `v1.0.0` flag format. \\n\\nSo we decided to restart our flag editor from scratch and to allow the possibility to create flags configuration from a simple UI. \\n\\n![Kapture 2023-01-20 at 16.16.50.gif](flag_editor.gif)\\n\\nFor now it is a tiny UI that make your life easier, but the goal is to evolve it more and more to be the place where you want to go to build your new feature flags.\\n\\n# What has not changed?\\n\\nYes a lot of things have changed but our internals are solids and we have ensure to be consistent with the previous versions.\\n\\nOur main points of attention where the following:\\n\\n- User segmentation is similar between `v0.x.x` and `v1.0.0` meaning that if a user was affected by a flag (in a percentage for example) he will continue to be in the same cohort.\\n- All `retrievers` and data `exporters` have not changed and are still working exactly the same way as before.\\n- You can continue using **GO Feature Flags** with your old flags.\\n- Moving to the version `v1.0.0` is transparent and you just have to change the version.\\n- You can still use our advance rollout capabilities such as **experimentation**, **scheduled rollout**, **progressive rollout \u2026**\\n\\n# Feedback\\n\\nFeedbacks is our only way to evolve GO Feature Flag, so please contact us to give us any feedback.\\n\\n- Via [email](mailto:contact@gofeaturegflag.org)\\n- Via a

Marketing\\nteams can be challenging.\\n\\nWhile it seems easy to launch something new, a poorly executed rollout can end up being your worst nightmare.\\n\\nIn this article, I will present to you how to use the Go module go-feature-flag to roll out your new features smoothly\\nand help you be confident during the rollout phase. If you are not familiar with the concept of feature flags or feature\\ntoggles, I encourage you to read\\nthis [article by Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html).\\n\\ngo-feature-flag is a Go module to easily manage your flags. You can refer to this article I wrote a few months ago to\\nunderstand how it works.\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How To Use go-feature-flag\\n\\nThe library is super simple to use:\\n\\n1. Install the module:\\n\\n```go\\ngo get github.com/thomaspoignant/go -feature-flag\\n```\\n\\n2. Init the client with the location of your configuration file for your flags:\\n\\n```go\\nerr := ffclient.Init(ffclient.Config{\\nPollInterval: 60,\\nRetriever: &ffclient.HTTPRetriever{\\nURL:    \\"http://example.com/flag-config.yaml\\",\\n},\\n})\\ndefer ffclient.Close()\\n```\\n\\n3. Put your new features conditionally based on the flag value:\\n\\n```go\\nuser := ffcontext.NewEvaluationContext(\\"user-unique-key\\")\\nhasFlag, _ := ffclient.BoolVariation(\\"test-flag\\", user, false)\\nif hasFlag {\\n// flag \\"test-flag\\" is true for the user\\n} else {\\n// flag \\"test-flag\\" is false for the user\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can have way more configuration, but I\u2019ll let you check\\nthe [documentation](https://docs.gofeatureflag.org) for that.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Progressive Rollout\\n\\nWhen you release a new feature that can have a strong impact on your system, you probably don\u2019t want to go all-in with\\nthis new feature for all your users.\\n\\nFor example, you are deploying something that can be CPU-consuming and you want to have time to check if your servers\\nhandle it correctly. This is typically a great use case for a progressive rollout.\\n\\nIt progressively increases how many users are impacted by your feature flag to avoid a big-bang rollout for all your\\nusers at once. During that time, it allows you to monitor your system and be confident that your infrastructure can\\nhandle this new load.\\n\\n:::warning\\nThe flag format bellow is the legacy format of GO Feature Flag.\\nRefer to the [documentation](/docs/configure_flag/create-flags) for the latest format.\\n:::\\n\\n```yaml\\nprogressive-flag:\\n  true: true\\n  false: false\\n  default: false\\n  rollout:\\n    progressive:\\n      percentage:\\n        initial: 0\\n        end: 100\\n      releaseRamp:\\n        start: 2021-03-20T00:00:00.10-05:00\\n        end: 2021-03-21T00:00:00.10-05:00\\n```\\n\\nTo do that in go-feature-flag, you will configure your flag like in the example above. You set up a progressive rollout\\nwith an initial percentage value and a release ramp. Over time, more and more users can be affected by the flag and will\\nhave the new feature.\\n\\nDepending on how critical this feature is, you can have a long or a short release ramp. If something goes wrong, you can\\nedit your flag to stop the rollout at any time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Scheduling Workflows\\n\\nScheduling introduces the ability for users to change their flags for future points in time. While this sounds\\ndeceptively straightforward, it unlocks the potential for users to create complex release strategies by scheduling the\\nincremental steps in advance.\\n\\nFor example, you may want to turn a feature on for internal testing tomorrow and then enable it for your \u201cbeta\u201d user\\nsegment four days later.\\n\\n```yaml\\nscheduled-flag:\\n  true: true\\n  false: false\\n  default: false\\n  percentage: 0\\n  rollout:\\n    scheduled:\\n      steps:\\n        - date: 2020-04-10T00:00:00.00+02:00\\n          rule: internal eq true\\n          percentage:\\n            100        - date: 2020-04-14T00:00:00.00+02:00\\n          rule:\\n            internal eq true and beta eq true        - date: 2020-04-18T00:00:00.00+02:00\\n          rule: \\"\\"\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, you can see that we are updating the flag multiple times to perform actions in the future. Let\u2019s detail\\nwhat will happen in this configuration:\\n\\n1. Before `2020\u201304\u201310`, the flag is not served.\\n2. After the first update of the flag (`2020\u201304\u201310`), we have 100% of the internal users who received the flag as true.\\n3. Four days later, we add the users who have a `bet`a flag as `true`.\\n4. Finally, four days later, we open the feature to all users.\\n\\nAs you can see, this is really powerful because your release management is now ready without doing any manual\\ndeployment/action, and this scheduling can be done by a non-technical user (aka your product manager).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Experimentation Rollout\\n\\nSometimes you also want to experiment, collect the data, and decide later if you want to roll out the feature to all\\nyour users.\\n\\nTo do that correctly, you can configure your flag with a start date and an end date for a subset of your users.\\n\\n```yaml\\nexperimentation-flag:\\n  percentage: 50\\n  true: true\\n  false: false\\n  default: false\\n  rule: userId sw \\"9\\"\\n  rollout:\\n    experimentation:\\n      start: 2021-03-20T00:00:00.10-05:00\\n      end: 2021-03-21T00:00:00.10-05:00\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, 50% of your users with a userId that starts with 9 will be impacted by the flag between the start and\\nthe end dates of the experimentation.\\n\\nWith the module, you can also collect the data of your variation (see\\nthe [documentation](https://docs.gofeatureflag.org/) for more info) to join them with\\nthe data of what you are testing.\\n\\nSo you can see the results of your experimentation and decide whether you want to roll out this flag for real or not.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUsing feature flags really is a great thing, but it becomes even better if you use some advanced rollout strategies.\\n\\nIf you start using them, you will love it because you decouple the deployment and the release and you can have\\nfine-grained control over what your users can do."},{"id":"introduction-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/introduction-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/tree/main/website/blog/2021-01-11-introduction-blog-post/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-01-11-introduction-blog-post/index.md","title":"Introduction blog post","description":"I absolutely don\u2019t think human/manual QA gates should be involved in between the writing of code and its being live.

To avoid breaking things every time and to have an early cutoff system, you should use feature flags.\\n\\nThere are a lot of systems available on the market to manage your flags, like [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) or [UNLEASH](https://unleash.org/), that have Golang support \u2014 but this option is expensive, and you have to host a server somewhere to manage your flags.\\n\\nFrom this starting point, I came up with the idea to create a simple library with only one file in the back end. This file can be stored in different places (AWS S3, GitHub, an HTTP endpoint somewhere, etc.). This is the only thing you have to host \u2014 all the decision logic stands inside the Go module.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why a new solution?\\n\\nThere are some solutions available for Go to manage feature flags. I can classify them into two categories:\\n\\n- You need to run a specific service: [markphelps/flipt](https://github.com/markphelps/flipt), [checkr/flagr](https://github.com/checkr/flagr), [Unleash/unleash](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash), [vsco/dcdr](https://github.com/vsco/dcdr), etc.\\n- You need to have a database: [xchapter7x/toggle](https://github.com/xchapter7x/toggle), [AntoineAugusti/feature-flags](https://github.com/AntoineAugusti/feature-flags), etc.\\n\\nAll of these solutions are great and have a lot of features, but I was a bit worried about having a full setup with things to install before doing feature flags on a basic service.\\n\\nI don\u2019t want to host/maintain/monitor a full feature-flag system if my needs are really small.\\n\\nSo I decided to make go-feature-flag, a simple and easy-to-implement feature-flag system, with no back end at all except a shared configuration file you can store anywhere (S3, GitHub, HTTP endpoint, etc.).\\n\\nThe goal is to experience the usage of feature flags without a complex solution, and if you end up liking it and need a more advanced pattern, you can go to any open-source solution or SaaS solution \u2014 like LaunchDarkly, for example.\\n\\n--- \\n\\n## How Does It Work?\\n\\nHow this Go module works is easy. It just reads the shared file every x seconds and gives you a way to get the value of your flag in the type you expect.\\n\\n![](./sdk-explanation.jpg)\\n\\nAs you can see, what go-feature-flag is providing is a way for you to keep in sync with the feature-flag config file. It also allows you to evaluate the flag for your users.\\n\\nA rule system based on [nikunjy/rules](https://github.com/nikunjy/rules) allows you to specify complex rules to apply the flag only for a subset of your users.\\n\\nThe percentage allows you to select which percentage of users will get the true value, but I\u2019m sure you wonder how the repartition is done. It\u2019s really easy \u2014 we\u2019re doing a hash of the key of the user with the flag name used as a salt (it guarantees that the repartition isn\u2019t always to the same users).\\n\\n![](./code.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How to Use It\\n\\nThe main goal of go-feature-flag is to be super simple so you don\u2019t have much to do in order to use it.\\n\\n- The first thing to do is host your config file somewhere (S3, GitHub, etc.)\\n- During app initialization, init go-feature-flag with a configuration:\\n\\n```go\\nerr := ffclient.Init(ffclient.Config{\\n    PollInterval: 3,\\n    Retriever: &ffClient.HTTPRetriever{\\n        URL:    \\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/main/testdata/test.yaml\\",\\n    },\\n})\\ndefer ffclient.Close()\\n```\\n\\n- Now that you\u2019ve done an init on go-feature-flag, you can see the value of the flag for your users, with something like this:\\n\\n```go\\nuser := ffcontext.NewEvaluationContext(\\"user-unique-key\\")\\nhasFlag, _ := ffclient.BoolVariation(\\"test-flag\\", user, false)\\nif hasFlag {\\n    // flag \\"test-flag\\" is true for the user\\n} else {\\n    // flag \\"test-flag\\" is false for the user\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Note**: Your variation will return the default value (the last parameter) if you have an error (flag not present, wrong type, etc.).\\n\\n- It\u2019s a basic example, but you can put as many properties as you want for your User to make complex queries on your flag\\n\\n```go\\nuser = ffcontext.NewEvaluationContextBuilder(\\"user-unique-key\\").\\n AddCustom(\\"firstname\\", \\"John\\").\\n AddCustom(\\"lastname\\", \\"Doe\\").\\n AddCustom(\\"email\\", \\"john.doe@example.com\\").\\n Build()\\n```\\n\\nThis allows you to have a rule like `email eq \\"john.doe@example.com\\"` to select a specific user with your flag.\\n\\n--- \\n\\n## What\u2019s Next?\\nAs you can see go-feature-flag is simple, and the goal is to keep it as simple as possible. But this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s finished.\\n\\nFor now, I see an evolutionary path for go-feature-flag: First, it should be able to store the flag config file anywhere, so we have to support more retrievers. The second thing is to get more feedback. For now, we\u2019re logging some stuff, but maybe some users would like to have a webhook or Slack notification.\\n\\ngo-feature-flag is also open to contribution, so if you want to contribute any ideas or help, I\u2019d really love to hear from you concerning what you think about this library and what you want in it.\\n\\nSo feel free to write [a discussion](https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/discussions) on GitHub, open an [issue](https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/issues), or send me an [email](mailto:contact@gofeatureflag.org)."}]}}')}}]);
