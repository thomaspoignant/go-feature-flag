A feature flag solution, with YAML file in the backend (S3, HTTP, local file ...).  
No server to install, just add a file in a central system *(HTTP, S3, ...)* and all your services will react to the changes of this file.


If you are not familiar with feature flags also called feature Toggles you can read this [article of Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html)
that explain why this is a great pattern.  
I've also right an [article](https://medium.com/better-programming/feature-flags-and-how-to-iterate-quickly-7e3371b9986) that explain why feature flags can help you to iterate quickly.

## Installation
```bash
go get github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag
```

## Quickstart
First, you need to initialize the `ffclient` with the location of your backend file.
```go
err := ffclient.Init(ffclient.Config{
    PollInterval: 3,
    HTTPRetriever: &ffClient.HTTPRetriever{
        URL:    "http://example.com/test.yaml",
    },
})
defer ffclient.Close()
```
*This example will load a file from an HTTP endpoint and will refresh the flags every 3 seconds.*

Now you can evalute your flags anywhere in your code.
```go
user := ffuser.NewUser("user-unique-key")
hasFlag, _ := ffclient.BoolVariation("test-flag", user, false)
if hasFlag {
    // flag "test-flag" is true for the user
} else {
    // flag "test-flag" is false for the user
}
```

## Where do I store my flags file
`go-feature-flags` support different ways of retrieving the flag file.  
We can have only one source for the file, if you set multiple sources in your configuration, only one will be take in consideration.

### From a file
```go
err := ffclient.Init(ffclient.Config{
    PollInterval: 3,
    LocalFile: "file-example.yaml",
})
defer ffclient.Close()
```

I will not recommend using a file to store your flags except if it is in a shared folder for all your services.

### From an HTTP endpoint
```go
err := ffclient.Init(ffclient.Config{
    PollInterval: 3,
     HTTPRetriever: &ffClient.HTTPRetriever{
        URL:    "http://example.com/test.yaml",
    },
})
defer ffclient.Close()
```

To configure your HTTP endpoint:
- **URL**: location of your file. **MANDATORY**
- **Method**: the HTTP method you want to use *(default is GET)*.
- **Body**: If you need a body to get the flags.
- **Header**: Header you should pass while calling the endpoint *(useful for authorization)*.

### From a S3 Bucket
```go
err := ffclient.Init(ffclient.Config{
    PollInterval: 3,
    S3Retriever: &ffClient.S3Retriever{
        Bucket: "tpoi-test",
        Item:   "test.yaml",
        AwsConfig: aws.Config{
            Region: aws.String("eu-west-1"),
        },
    },
})
defer ffclient.Close()
```

To configure your S3 file location:
- **Bucket**: The name of your bucket. **MANDATORY**
- **Item**: The location of your file in the bucket. **MANDATORY**
- **AwsConfig**: An instance of `aws.Config` that configure your access to AWS *(see [this documentation for more info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html))*. **MANDATORY**

## Flags file format
`go-feature-flag` is to avoid to have to host a backend to manage your feature flags and to keep them centralized by using a file a source.  
Your file should be a YAML file with a list of flags *([see example](testdata/test.yaml))*.

A flag configuration looks like:
```yaml
test-flag:
  percentage: 100
  rule: key eq "random-key"
  true: true
  false: false
  default: false
  disable: false
```

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|`test-flag`   |![mandatory](https://img.shields.io/badge/-mandatory-red)   |  Name of the flag. It should be unique.  |
|`percentage`   |![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-green)   |  Percentage of the users affect by the flag.<br>**Default value is 0**  |
|`rule`   |![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-green)   |  This is the query use to select on which user the flag should apply.<br>Rule format is describe in the [rule format section](#rule-format).<br>**If no rule set, the flag apply to all users *(percentage still apply)*.** |
|`true`   |![mandatory](https://img.shields.io/badge/-mandatory-red)   |  The value return by the flag if apply to the user *(rule is evaluated to true)* and user is in the active percentage. |
|`false`   |![mandatory](https://img.shields.io/badge/-mandatory-red)   |  The value return by the flag if apply to the user *(rule is evaluated to true)* and user is **not** in the active percentage. |
|`disable`   |![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-green)   |  True if the flag is disabled. |

## Rule format
The rule format is based on the [`nikunjy/rules`](https://github.com/nikunjy/rules) library.

All the operations can be written capitalized or lowercase (ex: eq or EQ can be used).  
Logical Operations supported are `AND` `OR`.

Compare Expression and their definitions (`a|b` means you can use either one of the two `a` or `b`):

```
eq|==: equals to 
ne|!=: not equals to
lt|<: less than 
gt|>: greater than
le|<=: less than equal to
ge|>=: greater than equal to 
co: contains 
sw: starts with 
ew: ends with
in: in a list
pr: present
not: not of a logical expression
```

### Examples

- Select a specific user: `key eq "example@example.com"`
- Select all identified users: `anonymous ne true`
- Select a user with a custom property: `userId eq "12345"`
