# Open Feature

GO Feature Flag is not providing any SDKs, we are relying on [Open Feature](https://openfeature.dev) for that, but we offer
providers compatible with the those SDKs to be able to use the tool in other languages.

## Where to find the providers sources?
All the providers are hosted directly in the `contrib` repository of Open Feature.

- [`Java`](https://github.com/open-feature/java-sdk-contrib/tree/main/providers/go-feature-flag)
- [`GO`](https://github.com/open-feature/go-sdk-contrib/tree/main/providers/go-feature-flag)
- [`Typescript` / `Javascript`](https://github.com/open-feature/js-sdk-contrib/tree/main/libs/providers/go-feature-flag)
- [`.Net`](https://github.com/open-feature/dotnet-sdk-contrib/tree/main/src/OpenFeature.Contrib.Providers.GOFeatureFlag)

## Documentation
