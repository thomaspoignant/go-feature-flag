# ðŸ“ˆ Profiling

The **relay proxy** is able to expose profiling information.  
This is useful to understand the performance of the service and solve potential issues.

The information are exposed on the `/debug/pprof` endpoint, and we are using the default `net/http/pprof` package
to expose the information.

:::warning
By default the profiling endpoints are disabled, and must be enabled in the configuration file.
:::

List of endpoints exposed is available http://localhost:1031/debug/pprof/

### Enable profiling

In your relay proxy configuration file you need to set the `enablePprof` field to `true`.

```yaml {5} title="goff-proxy.yaml"
retriever:
  kind: file
  path: /goff/flags.yaml
#  ...
enablePprof: true
```

:::note
The `debug` field also enables profiling, but it is deprecated.
```yaml title="goff-proxy.yaml"
#...
debug: true
```
