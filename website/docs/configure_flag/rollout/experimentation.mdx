# Experimentation rollout / A/B Testing
An **experimentation rollout** is when your flag is configured to be served only for a determined time.

1. It means that before the rollout start date, the `default` value is served to all users.
2. Between the dates the flag is evaluated.
3. After the end date the `default` value is served to all users.

## Example

<Tabs groupId="code">
  <TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

```yaml
experimentation-flag:
  variations:
    variationA: A
    variationB: B
  defaultRule:
    percentage:
      variationA: 50
      variationB: 50
  # highlight-start
  experimentation:
    start: 2021-03-20T00:00:00.1-05:00
    end: 2021-03-21T00:00:00.1-05:00
  # highlight-end
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="json" label="JSON">

```json
{
  "experimentation-flag": {
    "variations": {
      "variationA": "A",
      "variationB": "B"

      "end": "2021-03-21T05:00:00.100Z"
    },
# highlight-end
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="toml" label="TOML">

```toml

[experimentation-flag.defaultRule.percentage]
variationA = 50

# highlight-start
[experimentation-flag.experimentation]

## Configuration fields

:::info
The dates are in the format supported natively by your flag file format.
:::

| Field       | Description                                     |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **`start`** | The date the flag will be started to be served. |
| **`end`**   | The date the flag will be stopped to be served. |

## A/B testing

:::info
A/B test is the shorthand for a simple controlled experiment.
As the name implies, two versions (A and B) of a single variable are compared, which are identical except for one variation that might affect a user's behavior.
A/B tests are widely considered the simplest form of controlled experiment.

_**(source wikipedia)**_
:::

To have a proper A/B testing solution with the module you should use the experimentation rollout combined with the [export of your data](../../go_module/data_collection/).

This combination will allow to have your experimentation running for a dedicated time, and you will have the data to know exactly which user was on which version of the flag.

To setup the duration of your A/B test you can use a tool [ab-test-duration-calculator](https://vwo.com/tools/ab-test-duration-calculator/) from vwo, that will help you to set up the test duration correctly.
