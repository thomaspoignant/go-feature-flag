# 📣 Notify flag changes

## Overview
In GO Feature Flag, if you want to be informed when a flag has changed, you can configure a [notifier](../concepts/notifier).

A notifier will send one notification to the targeted system to inform them that a new flag configuration has been loaded.

## About notifiers
Notifiers are useful for a variety of purposes, such as:
- **Information**: Notifiers can send to your team chat a notification that a feature flag has changed.
- **Reacting to flag changes**: Using the webhook notifier, you can trigger any action you want in your system to react to flag changes.

When the GO Feature Flag client detects a change in the configuration through the retriever's polling mechanism, it triggers the configured notifiers.

:::info
GO Feature Flag can handle more than one notifier at a time.
:::

:::warning **Limitation if you are running multiple GO Feature Flag**
By nature, GO Feature Flag is 100% stateless, so if you run multiple instance of GO Feature Flag, you will receive notification for changes from each instance.
In each notification you will have the `hostname` of the instance, it can be useful if you have multiple GO Feature Flag running.
:::


You have 2 different ways to specify a notifier depending on if you are using the **GO Module** or the **Relay Proxy**.
In all the details pages of the retrievers bellow you will have an example for both examples.

## Available Notifiers
Bellow is the full list of notifiers that are available in GO Feature Flag.

<div className={"grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4"}>
  {getIntegrations("").notifiers.filter(item => item.docLink !== undefined).map((item) => {
    return (
      <Card
        logo={item.logo}
        link={`notify-flags-changes/${item.docLink}`}
        name={item.name}
        cssLogo={item.faLogo}
        description={item.description}
      />
    );
  })}
</div>

## Custom notifier
If you have a specific use case that is not covered by the built-in notifiers, you can create your own custom exporter.

To create a custom notifier you must have a struct that implements the notifier.Notifier interface.

In param you will receive a `notifier.DiffCache` struct that will tell you what has changed in your flag configuration.

```go title="notifier.go"
import (
    ffclient "github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag"
    "github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/notifier/notifier"
    "sync"
)

type Notifier struct{}
func (c *Notifier) Notify(diff notifier.DiffCache) error {
    // ...
    // do whatever you want here
}
```

:::note
If you think your custom notifier could be useful for others, feel free to open a [pull request](https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/pulls) to add it to the list of available notifiers.

:::warning
If you are using a custom exporter, it is easy to use it for the GO Module, but if you want to use it in the relay proxy you will have to recompile it yourself.
