# ü§ù Contributing

## How to contribute
**GO Feature Flag** is an open-source project and we welcome contributions of all kinds. 
There are many ways to help, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the main project itself.

We are always looking for new contributors and maintainers, so if you are interested in becoming a contributor, please read the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started!

## Community Meetings
We have a bi-weekly community meeting where we discuss the project and plan the future.
