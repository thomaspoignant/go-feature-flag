GO Feature Flag Relay Proxy is a powerful tool that enables you to evaluate your feature flags without deploying code changes.
It allows you to test and roll out new features to your users gradually, and to monitor the performance of your code in real-time.

With the recent release of version `v1.7.0`, GO Feature Flag Relay Proxy introduces a new feature that enhances the
security of your feature flag evaluations.
This new feature allows you to control who can access your relay proxy by configuring API Keys.

## Limiting Access with API Keys

With the release of GO Feature Flag Relay Proxy version `v1.7.0`, you can now limit access to the relay proxy by configuring API Keys.
This feature allows you to restrict access to only known clients, adding an additional layer of security to your feature flag evaluations.

To enable this feature, you need to add a list of API Keys to your configuration.
Only requests with these API Keys will be accepted. This means that any requests without a valid API Key will be rejected.

In your **relay proxy** configuration file it will look like this:
```yaml
# ...
# List of authorized API keys.
# Each request will need to provide one of authorized key inside Authorization header with format Bearer <api-key>.
# There will be no authorization when this config is not configured.
apiKeys:
  - 6147795c-4438-44f1-8ab2-18cb3fa9591f # apiKey for client 1
  - 3e3fb534-c8fd-42e9-8f2e-c80276b1685c # apiKey for client 2
  - 6603f9f8-2871-4149-81e8-8a362a8ae266 # apiKey for client 3
  - 0fc30ffe-b9bc-4398-a9f1-6f8b8486e8ce # apiKey for client 4
  - 500d222e-2654-41a4-bd31-e24a629cb78a # apiKey for client 5

# ...
```

## Using Client API Keys with Openfeature Providers

If you are using Open Feature and our providers, we have updated them to handle the `apiKey` for you.
You can now specify your `apiKey` directly when you are initializing your provider. This will authenticate every request
to the relay proxy with this apiKey.

To use this feature, you need to specify the client API Key in your Open Feature provider initialization.
This can be done by adding the `apiKey` like this:

      <TabItem value="go" label="GO">

```go
provider, err := gofeatureflag.NewProvider(gofeatureflag.ProviderOptions{
  //...
  APIKey:   "6147795c-4438-44f1-8ab2-18cb3fa9591f",
})
```

  </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="dotnet" label=".NET">

```dotnet
GoFeatureFlagProviderOptions options = new GoFeatureFlagProviderOptions{
    // ...
    ApiKey = "6147795c-4438-44f1-8ab2-18cb3fa9591f"
  }

GoFeatureFlagProvider authenticatedProvider = new GoFeatureFlagProvider(options);
```

  </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="JAVA">

```java
GoFeatureFlagProviderOptions options =
      GoFeatureFlagProviderOptions.builder()
      .apiKey("6147795c-4438-44f1-8ab2-18cb3fa9591f")
      .endpoint(relayProxyAuthenticatedEndpoint)
      .build();

GoFeatureFlagProvider provider = new GoFeatureFlagProvider(options);
```

  </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="javascript" label="JS / TS">

```javascript
const goFeatureFlagProvider = new GoFeatureFlagProvider({
  // ...
  apiKey: '6147795c-4438-44f1-8ab2-18cb3fa9591f'
});
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
