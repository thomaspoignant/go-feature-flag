# Watch Thomas's PlatformCon 2025 Talk on Feature Flag Decoupling

We're excited to share that Thomas Poignant, creator of GO Feature Flag, presented an insightful talk at **PlatformCon 2025** about decoupling deployments from feature releases using OpenFeature.

## Talk: "Decouple Deployments and Releases with OpenFeature"

In this presentation, Thomas explores how traditional deployment strategies often directly couple feature releases with code deployments, increasing risks and slowing time-to-market. He demonstrates how **OpenFeature**, a vendor-agnostic API for feature flagging, enables developers to separate feature releases from code deployments, providing precise control over feature visibility and experimentation.

## What You'll Learn

The talk covers several key concepts:

- **Fundamental feature flagging concepts** and how they transform development workflows
- **OpenFeature integration** and how it simplifies feature flag management across different providers
- **Real-world use cases** demonstrating the practical benefits of deployment/release decoupling
- **Best practices** for implementing feature flags effectively in development workflows
- **Risk reduction strategies** for safer and more controlled feature rollouts

## Why This Matters

In today's fast-paced development environment, the ability to deploy code without immediately releasing features to users has become crucial for:

- **Reducing deployment risks** by allowing features to be tested in production before user exposure
- **Faster time-to-market** through independent deployment and release cycles
- **Enhanced experimentation capabilities** with controlled feature rollouts
- **Improved incident response** with the ability to quickly disable problematic features

## About PlatformCon 2025

PlatformCon is the premier conference for platform engineering, bringing together industry experts to share insights on building and scaling development platforms. Thomas's talk was part of the conference's focus on modern development practices and tooling that enable engineering teams to ship software more effectively.
