In the ever-evolving world of software development, feature flag solutions have become instrumental in enabling continuous integration and deployment.
These solutions allow developers to toggle features on and off without deploying new code, providing flexibility and control over feature releases.

But sometimes you need to give context about your flag, is it linked to an issue? Do you need a precise description? ...
To respond to this, **GO Feature Flag** has recently introduced an exciting new feature: **the ability to add metadata to each flag configuration**.

With the version `v1.11.0` of GO Feature Flag, developers can now add valuable metadata to their flag configurations.
This metadata serves as additional information linked directly to each flag, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of its purpose and context.
This metadata can include essential details such as issue tracker links, descriptions, or any other information that developers deem relevant.

## Improved Code Efficiency
The inclusion of metadata in flag configurations brings substantial benefits in terms of code efficiency and reusability.
By using the `VariationDetails` functions, developers can easily retrieve the associated metadata when working with the flag.

This eliminates the need for additional queries or requests to obtain essential information related to a specific flag.
Developers can conveniently leverage this information within their code, leading to streamlined development processes and improved overall efficiency.

## How to add the metadata?
We have introduced a new field in the configuration of your flag

```yaml
example_flag:
  variations:
    A: true
    B: false
  defaultRule:
    variation: B
  metadata:
    description: this is a super simple example feature flag
    issue-link: https://jira.xxx/GOFF-01
```

Now that you have this field available you can read the metadata in your `VariationDetails` when the evaluation is done.

GO Feature Flag relay-proxy also enable seamless access to the added metadata.

## Open Feature SDK Compatibility
To further enhance the usability and compatibility of GO Feature Flag, the new metadata feature aligns with the **v0.6.0** version of the Open Feature specification.
This update ensures that the metadata can be retrieved seamlessly using the Open Feature SDKs.

As soon as the SDKs will compatible with the metadata we will support it in the different GO Feature Flag providers.

## Conclusion
The introduction of metadata support in GO Feature Flag marks a significant milestone in feature flag solutions.
Enabling developers to attach relevant information directly to their flag configurations opens up new possibilities for
enhanced flag management and streamlined development processes.
With the ability to retrieve metadata, developers can access essential information with ease.

The compatibility with the Open Feature SDK further solidifies the integration capabilities and ensures seamless utilization of metadata throughout the development cycle.
Embrace the power of metadata and unlock a new level of control and efficiency in your feature flag management with GO Feature Flag's latest update.
