Effective management of the feature flag lifecycle is crucial for maximizing the value of feature flags within an organization.

This presentation is covering the following key areas:
- **Feature flag lifecycle:** Understanding the complete journey of a feature flag.
- **Roles and responsibilities:** Identifying who owns each phase of the lifecycle.
- **Feature flag naming conventions:** Best practices for clear and consistent flag identification.
- **Preventing flag debt:** Strategies for avoiding the accumulation of unused or obsolete flags.
- **Involving project managers:** The importance of project management collaboration in feature flag initiatives.

By understanding these concepts, you can optimize your feature flagging strategy and drive business success.
