Earlier this week the super cool podcast Devâ€™Obs asked me to talk about feature flags, go-feature-flag and also the super nice initiative OpenFeature.

The podcast is in French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· (yes I know sorryâ€¦) but you can learn a lot of cool things, when to use them, what is OpenFeature about and all the cool things that the feature flags can bring to your developer experience.
