Feature management is the process of controlling the availability and visibility of features within a software application or website.

It enables organizations to release features in a controlled and incremental way, allowing them to test and iterate on new features without impacting the user experience.

Feature management, or feature flag management, is a game changer for software development because it allows organizations to decouple the **release of new features** from their **deployment** to production.
By using feature flags, developers can safely release new features to a subset of users, test them, and collect feedback before rolling them out to all users.

This enables organizations to mitigate risk, iterate quickly, and deliver a personalized user experience.

In addition, feature management provides organizations with valuable insights into how their features are being used, and whether they are meeting their intended goals.

By collecting usage data and feedback from users, organizations can make informed decisions about which features to invest in, which to improve, and which to retire.
