## Definition

> A collection of related flags. This grouping helps organize feature flags based on their intended use, facilitating easier management and deployment.  
> _Source: [Openfeature glossary](https://openfeature.dev/specification/glossary/#flag-set)._


## Context

As of today, GO Feature Flag is evaluating flag differently for client and server evaluations.

- In the **client-side**, we are evaluating the flags in bulk, and we are keeping the evaluation responses in memory for the duration of the application.
- In the **server-side**, we are evaluating the flags 1 by 1, and we are not keeping the evaluation responses in memory _(except if a cache is configured)_.

In both cases having a flag set could be beneficial, for **performance reasons**, but also for **organization reasons**. 

### When do we want to use flag sets?
- We have multiple teams using the same GO Feature Flag instance, and we want to separate the flags evaluated by each team.
- We have different platforms using GO Feature Flag, and we want to limit which flags are evaluated by each platform.
- We want to give access to a list of flags to a specific user group.
- We want to allow 2 flags with the same name if they are used by different teams or platforms.
- We have a lot of flags, and we want to evaluate only a subset of them for a specific context _(e.g. on my ios application)_.

**For all those points, as of today the only way to achieve this is to run multiple instances of GO Feature Flag, which is not ideal.**

## Requirements

- A flag can be part of only 1 flag set.
- Flag name are unique within a flag set, but not across flag sets.
- GO Feature Flag should have a `default` flag set for users not using the flag sets feature _(the behaviours should be exactly the same as of today if the feature is not used)_.
- When calling the bulk evaluation APIs (`/ofrep/v1/evaluate/flags` or `/v1/allflags`), we will determine which flag set to evaluate based on API key used.
- The bulk evaluation APIs should evaluate only 1 flag set at a time _(to avoid collision in flag names)_.
- It should be able to specify which flag set to evaluate when calling the evaluation APIs. _(e.g. `/ofrep/v1/evaluate/flags` or `/ofrep/v1/evaluate/flags/{flag_key}`)_.
  - Ideally we should be able to know which flag set to used based on the API Key used.
  - If GOFF is configured to be public, we should be able to specify the flag set to evaluate in the request _(with a specific header ex:`goff-flag-set`)_.
  - In the providers, we should be able to specify the flag set to evaluate directly in the constructor _(by providing an API Key, or the name of the flag set)_.
- Admin API Keys, should be able to evaluate all the flag sets _(to be able to see all the flags available in the project)_. If none specified in the request, the default flag set should be evaluated.

## Out of scope for now
- Dynamic flag sets based on the evaluation context _([as mentioned in this slack message](https://gophers.slack.com/archives/C029TH8KDFG/p1732703075509229))_.
- Single retrievers for multiple flag sets _(as proposed in https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/issues/2314)_.

_Even if out of scope for now, those are interesting options that we may want to implement later._

## Proposed solution

### Solution 1: 1 flag set per file

In this solution we consider that we need at least one file per flag set.  
All the flags retrieved by a `retriever` _(aka in the same file)_ will be associated to the same flag set.

We can specify the flag set name in the configuration file.  
As of today, we can still have multiple files for 1 flag set _(by specifying the same `flagSet` name in each file)_,
and we will have the same mechanism as of today _(with flag overridden in case of flag name collision)_.

#### Flags configuration file
```yaml
# config-file1.goff.yaml
# Syntax used in this example is just for the sake of the example, it is not the final syntax.
flagSet: flagset-teamA

featureA-enabled:
  variations:
      enabled: true
      disabled: false
  defaultRule:
    variation: enabled
```
```yaml
# config-file2.goff.yaml
flagSet: flagset-teamB

featureA-enabled:
  variations:
      enabled: true
      disabled: false
  defaultRule:
    variation: enabled
```

#### Relay-proxy configuration example
```yaml
# ...
retrievers:
  - kind: file
    path: config-file1.goff.yaml
  - kind: file
    path: config-file2.goff.yaml

authorizedKeys:
  evaluation:
    - apikey1 # owner: userID1
    - apikey2 # owner: userID2
  admin:
    - apikey3
```

**PRO**
- It is simple to configure a flag set by putting all the flags at the same place.
- It is easy to understand which flags are part of a flag set.
- It is easy to give ownership of a flag set to a team, by giving them access to the file.

**CON**
- The flag set configuration is at the same place as the flag configuration, so it is possible to edit the flag set name directly inside the file _(risk of overriding another flag set)_.
- If we want the same flag to be part of multiple flag sets, we need to duplicate the flag in multiple files.

### Solution 2: specify the flag set in the retriever configuration

In this solution we consider that we need at least one file per flag set.  
All the flags retrieved by a `retriever` _(aka in the same file)_ will be associated to the same flag set.

We associate the flag set to the retriever in the configuration,
#### Flags configuration file
```yaml
# config-file1.goff.yaml
featureA-enabled:
  variations:
      enabled: true
      disabled: false
  defaultRule:
    variation: enabled
```
```yaml
# config-file2.goff.yaml
featureA-enabled:
  variations:
      enabled: true
      disabled: false
  defaultRule:
    variation: enabled
```

#### Relay-proxy configuration example
```yaml
# ...
retrievers:
  - kind: file
    path: config-file1.goff.yaml
    flagSet: flagset-teamA
  - kind: file
    path: config-file2.goff.yaml
    flagSet: flagset-teamB

authorizedKeys:
  evaluation:
    - apikey1 # owner: userID1
    - apikey2 # owner: userID2
  admin:
    - apikey3
```

**PRO**
- It is simple to configure a flag set by putting all the flags at the same place.
- It is easy to understand which flags are part of a flag set.
- It is easy to give ownership of a flag set to a team, by giving them access to the file.
- The flag set name is directly associated to the retriever, so it is not possible to edit it directly inside the file.

**CON**
- If we want the same flag to be part of multiple flag sets, we need to duplicate the flag in multiple files.

### Solution 3
In this solution we want to offer multiple way to specify the flag set in the configuration.  
This solution will be more complex to implement, but it will give more flexibility to the users.

In this solution the flag set could be defined:
1. In the retriever configuration _(like in solution 2)_.
2. And in the flag configuration file with a specific format.

This 2 ways of defining a flag set can lead to 2 concepts:
- **static flag set**: the flag set is defined in the retriever configuration, we know in advance that this flag set exists.
- **dynamic flag set**: the flag set is defined in the flag configuration file, we don't know in advance which flag sets exist.

#### example: In the retriever configuration

The relay proxy configuration will look like this:
```yaml
# ...
retrievers:
  - kind: file
    path: config-file.goff.yaml
    flagSet: flagset-teamA
# ...
```

And the flag configuration file (`config-file.goff.yaml`) will look like this:
```yaml
# all the flags in this file will be part of the flag set flagset-teamA
# ...
test-flag:
  variations:
    enabled: true
    disabled: false
  defaultRule:
    variation: enabled
# ...
```

#### example: In the flag configuration file with a specific format

In that case we don't need to specify the flag set in the retriever configuration.  
The relay proxy configuration will look like this:
```yaml
# ...
retrievers:
  - kind: file
    path: config-file.goff.yaml
# ...
```

And the flag configuration file (`config-file.goff.yaml`) will look like this:
```yaml
# flagSets is a new key in the configuration file, that allow to create a super set with multiple flag sets.
flagSets:
  - name: flagset-teamA
    flags:
      test-flag2:
        variations:
          Default: false
          False: false
          True: true
        targeting:
          - name: rule1
            query: key eq "not-a-key"
            percentage:
              False: 0
              True: 100
        defaultRule:
          name: defaultRule
          variation: Default
  - name: flagset-teamB
    flags:
      test-flag2:
        # ...
```

**PRO**
- It gives flexibility in the way of creating the flag sets _(in the retriever or in the flag configuration file)_.
- We can create multiple flag sets from a single retriver, by generating multiple flag sets in the flag configuration file.
- We can still have multiple files for 1 flag set _(by specifying the same `flagSet` name in each file)_.
- If we don't want to change the format of our configuration file, we can still set the flag sey in the retriever configuration.

**CON**
- If we configure a flag set name both in the retriever and in the flag configuration file, we need to decide which one to use _(most likely the one in the file)._
- It is a bit more complex to implement than the other solutions.
- It will not be possible to attach a specific `notifier` or `exporter` to a dynamic flag set.
