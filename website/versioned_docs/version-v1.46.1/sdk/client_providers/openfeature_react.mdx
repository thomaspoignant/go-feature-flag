This page describes how to use the OpenFeature React SDK for your client application.

## About this provider
OpenFeature React SDK allows you to connect to your GO Feature Flag instance with the `@openfeature/react-sdk`.

If you work with React the `@openfeature/react-sdk` will give you a better integration with your React application.
To integrate it with GO Feature Flag, you need to use the `@openfeature/go-feature-flag-web-provider` provider.



## Install the provider

```shell
npm install @openfeature/go-feature-flag-web-provider
npm install @openfeature/web-sdk
npm install @openfeature/react-sdk
npm install @openfeature/core
```

## How to use the provider?

### OpenFeatureProvider context provider
The OpenFeatureProvider is a React context provider which represents a scope for feature flag evaluations within a React application.
It binds an OpenFeature client to all evaluations within child components, and allows the use of evaluation hooks.

```typescript
import { EvaluationContext, OpenFeature, OpenFeatureProvider, useFlag } from "@openfeature/react-sdk";
import { GoFeatureFlagWebProvider } from "@openfeature/go-feature-flag-web-provider";

const goFeatureFlagWebProvider = new GoFeatureFlagWebProvider({
  endpoint: "http://localhost:1031"
});

// Set the initial context for your evaluations
OpenFeature.setContext({
  targetingKey: "user-1",
  admin: false
});

// Instantiate and set our provider (be sure this only happens once)!
// Note: there's no need to await its initialization, the React SDK handles re-rendering and suspense for you!
OpenFeature.setProvider(goFeatureFlagWebProvider);

// Enclose your content in the configured provider
function App() {
  return (
    <OpenFeatureProvider>
      <Page />
    </OpenFeatureProvider>
  );
}
```

### Evaluation hooks

Within the provider, you can use the various evaluation hooks to evaluate flags.
```typescript
function Page() {
  // Use the "query-style" flag evaluation hook, specifying a flag-key and a default value.
  const { value: showNewMessage } = useFlag('new-message', true);
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        {showNewMessage ? <p>Welcome to this OpenFeature-enabled React app!</p> : <p>Welcome to this React app.</p>}
      </header>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Advanced usage
You can check the [OpenFeature React SDK documentation](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/technologies/client/web/react) to see all the available hooks and how to use them.

## Available options
Check the available options for the provider in the [web provider page](./openfeature_javascript).

## Example
If you want to see some code, you can check the [example](https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/tree/main/examples/openfeature_react) in the GO Feature Flag repository.

## Features status
<FeatureTable sdk={sdk.find(it => it.key === 'react')} />

## Contribute to the provider
You can find the source of the provider in the [`open-feature/js-sdk-contrib`](https://github.com/open-feature/js-sdk-contrib/tree/main/libs/providers/go-feature-flag-web) repository.
