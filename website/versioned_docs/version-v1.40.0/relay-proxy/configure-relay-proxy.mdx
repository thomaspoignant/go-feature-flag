# ðŸ”§ Configuration

## Overview
In this page, you will find all the configuration options available for the **relay-proxy**.

The **GO Feature Flag relay-proxy** is highly configurable and can be adapted to your needs.
Despite that you can start with a minimum configuration and fine tune it later.

## Configuration file
The configuration of the **relay proxy** is based on a configuration file that you have to provide.
This is a `yaml` file and usage is to call it `goff-proxy.yaml` but you can name it as you will.

You can provide the configuration file with the option `--config=/path_to_your_file.yaml` when launching the relay proxy.

```shell
go-feature-flag --config=/goff-proxy.yaml
```

:::info
By default, if you omit the `--config` option, the relay proxy will look for a configuration file named `goff-proxy.yaml` in _(int this order)_:
1. `./` _(the current directory)_
2. `/goff/`
3. `/etc/opt/goff/`
:::


## Getting Started
The minimum configuration to start the **relay proxy** is to provide where to retrieve your feature flags configuration.

```yaml title="goff-proxy.yaml"
retrievers:
  - kind: file
    path: /goff/flags.yaml # Location of your feature flag files
```

All the other options are optional and can be added to the configuration file to fine-tune the **relay proxy**.



## Environment variables
The primary way to configure the relay proxy is through a configuration file, but you can also use environment variables if you prefer.  
You can override file configurations using environment variables.

**Here are some things to know when you are using environment variables:**
- To set an option, the environment variable should have the same name as the configuration option in uppercase.  
  For example, to set the `listen` option, you can set the `LISTEN` environment variable.
  ```shell
  export LISTEN=8080
  ```
- If you want to set a nested field, you can use `_` to separate each field.  
  For example, to set the `retrievers` option, you can set the `RETRIEVERS` environment variable.
  ```shell
  export RETRIEVER_KIND=github
  ```
- If you want to set an array of string, you can add multiple values separated by a comma.
  ```shell
  export AUTHORIZEDKEYS_EVALUATION=my-first-key,my-second-key
  ```
- If you are modifying an array of objects, you can use the index to set the value.
  ```shell
  export RETRIEVERS_0_KIND=github
  ```
## Configuration Options
### `retrievers`
This is the configuration on how to retrieve the configuration of the files.
- option name: `retrievers`
- type: [`[]retriever`](#type-retriever)
- default: **none**
- **mandatory: <Mandatory />**
- You can have multiple retrievers at the same time, check [_"Using multiple retrievers"_](../concepts/retriever#using-multiple-retrievers) to see how it works.
- Configuration of a retriever depends on the one you are choosing. Check the [list of retrievers](../integrations/store-flags-configuration#available-retrievers) and go on the detail page of your choice to configure it.

```yaml title="example goff-proxy.yaml"
retrievers:
  - kind: file
    path: /goff/my-flags.yaml
  - kind: s3
    bucket: my-featureflag-bucket
    item: flag/flags.goff.yaml
```

### `startWithRetrieverError`
By default, the **relay proxy** will crash if it is not able to retrieve the flags from the configuration.

If you don't want your relay proxy to crash, you can set `startWithRetrieverError` to true. Until the flag is retrievable the relay proxy will only answer with default values.
- option name: `startWithRetrieverError`
- type: **boolean**
- default: **`false`**
- mandatory: <NotMandatory />

### `persistentFlagConfigurationFile`
If set, GO Feature Flag will store the flags configuration in this file to be able to serve the flags even if none of the retrievers is available during starting time.
:::info
By default, the flag configuration is not persisted and stays on the retriever system. By setting a file here, you ensure that GO Feature Flag will always start with a configuration but which can be out-dated.
:::
- option name: `persistentFlagConfigurationFile`
- type: **string**
- default: **none**
- mandatory: <NotMandatory />
- example: `/tmp/goff_persist_conf.yaml`
