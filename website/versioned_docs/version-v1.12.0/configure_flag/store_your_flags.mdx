# Where to store your configuration flag
**GO Feature Flag** is a tool that makes it easy to implement feature flags in your application. One of the benefits of 
using GO Feature Flag is that it is designed to be simple and lightweight.  
To achieve this, the solution uses a file-based approach to configure your flags.

When you use GO Feature Flag, you create one or more file(s) _(`YAML`, `TOML` or `JSON`)_ that contains your feature 
flags and their values. You can then upload this file(s) where you want, and GO Feature Flag will use it.  
The way the solution achieves this is through the use of retrievers, which allow you to load your feature flag 
configuration file from various sources.

**Retrievers** are a core concept in GO Feature Flag. They are responsible for loading your feature flag configuration 
file from a specified location, such as a file on your local machine or a remote storage service. This allows you to 
store your configuration file in a location that works best for your workflow.

**GO Feature Flag** supports a variety of retrievers out of the box, including `S3`, `Google Cloud Storage`, `Github`, 
`HTTP`, `Kubernetes config maps`, `Local file` ...  
But you can also implement your own custom retriever if needed.

Using retrievers in GO Feature Flag is straightforward. You simply specify which retriever to use in your configuration 
file, along with any required configuration options. GO Feature Flag will then use the specified retriever to load your 
configuration file and will evaluate your feature flags based on this configuration.

## Use multiple configuration flag files
Sometimes, you may need to store your feature flags in different locations.
In such cases, you can configure multiple retrievers to retrieve the flags from different sources within your GO Feature
Flag instance.

To set this up, you need to configure the [`Retrievers`](../go_module/configuration#configuration-fields) field to
consume from different retrievers.
What this does is that it calls all the retrievers in parallel and applies them in the order you have provided.

Keep in mind that if a flag is defined in multiple retrievers, it can be overridden by a later flag. For instance,
if you have a flag named _`my-feature-flag`_ in the first file and another flag with the same name in the second file, the second configuration will take precedence.
