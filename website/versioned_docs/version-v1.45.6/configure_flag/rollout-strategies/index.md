# ðŸš€ Rollouts

## Overview
A critical part of every new feature release is orchestrating the actual launch schedule between Product, Engineering, and Marketing teams.

Delivering powerful user experiences typically requires software teams to manage complex releases and make manual updates at inconvenient times. But it doesnâ€™t have to! Having a complex rollout strategy allows you to have lifecycle for your flags.

## Releasing features with GO Feature Flag

The following table compares functionality that GO Feature Flag provides for releasing features:

| Release Option                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
