## What is GO Feature Flag?

GO Feature Flag is a lightweight, open-source solution that provides a simple and complete feature flag implementation.
It allows you to easily manage and control the release of new features in your applications.

GO Feature Flag is designed to be simple and easy to use, one of the key element is to reduce as much as possible the
complexity of the setup to let you experience feature flagging without any hassle.

Feature Flagging is a technique that allows you to enable/disable or configure features in your application without changing the code.
This is a complete shift in the way you can release new features to your users, by **decoupling the deployment from the release**.

If you are not familiar with feature flags, also called feature toggles, you can read this [article from Martin Fowler blog](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html)
where Pete Hodgson explains why this is a great pattern and how it can help you in your development process.

## Why is it called GO Feature Flag?
**GO Feature Flag** was initially developed for the GO language, but since it is rare to have only one language, it has been extended to support multiple languages.

Now with the combination of [Openfeature](https://openfeature.dev/) _(a project to standardize feature flagging)_, it is possible to use the same feature flags across multiple languages.

You can now use GO Feature Flag with {sdk.length} languages and we are relying only on the **Openfeature** standard to make it possible.
GO Feature Flag is unique in this way, as it is one of the only feature flag solution that is fully built on top of the standard.

## What can I do with GO Feature Flag?

You do a lot of things with GO Feature Flag, and we are adding new features on every release.
Here are some of the main things you can do:

- Evaluate feature flags in your application, with multiple flag types (`Bool`, `String`, `Int`, `Double` and `JSON`).
- Write complex targeting rules to target an audience with your flags based on the evaluation context.
- Use complex rollout strategies to progressively roll out a feature, run A/B testing or schedule your flag updates.
- Use GO Feature Flag in multiple languages, with the same flags configuration.
- Store your flag configuration where it suits you the best _(K8S configmap, S3, Azure Blob Storage, Github etc ...).
- Export evaluation data on different locations to analyze how your flags are used.
- Get notified when a flag has been changed, to be aware of the changes in your flags configuration.
- **And many more things you can discover in this documentation.**
