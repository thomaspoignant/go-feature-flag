# 🔧 Configuration

## Overview
In this page, you will find all the configuration options available for the **relay-proxy**.

The **GO Feature Flag relay-proxy** is highly configurable and can be adapted to your needs.
Despite that you can start with a minimum configuration and fine tune it later.

## Configuration file
The configuration of the **relay proxy** is based on a configuration file that you have to provide.
The configuration of the **relay proxy** is based on a configuration file that you have to provide.
This is a `yaml` file and usage is to call it `goff-proxy.yaml` but you can name it as you will.

You can provide the configuration file with the option `--config=/path_to_your_file.yaml` when launching the relay proxy.

```shell
go-feature-flag --config=/goff-proxy.yaml
```

:::info
By default, if you omit the `--config` option, the relay proxy will look for a configuration file named `goff-proxy.yaml` in _(int this order)_:
1. `./` _(the current directory)_
2. `/goff/`
3. `/etc/opt/goff/`
:::


## Getting Started
The minimum configuration to start the **relay proxy** is to provide where to retrieve your feature flags configuration.

```yaml title="goff-proxy.yaml"
retrievers:
  - kind: file
    path: /goff/flags.yaml # Location of your feature flag files
```

All the other options are optional and can be added to the configuration file to fine-tune the **relay proxy**.



## Environment variables
The primary way to configure the relay proxy is through a configuration file, but you can also use environment variables if you prefer.  
You can override file configurations using environment variables.

**Here are some things to know when you are using environment variables:**
- To set an option, the environment variable should have the same name as the configuration option in uppercase.  
  For example, to set the `listen` option, you can set the `LISTEN` environment variable.
  ```shell
  export LISTEN=8080
  ```
- If you want to set a nested field, you can use `_` to separate each field.  
  For example, to set the `retrievers` option, you can set the `RETRIEVERS` environment variable.
  ```shell
  export RETRIEVER_KIND=github
  ```
- If you want to set an array of string, you can add multiple values separated by a comma.
  ```shell
  export AUTHORIZEDKEYS_EVALUATION=my-first-key,my-second-key
  ```
- If you are modifying an array of objects, you can use the index to set the value.
  ```shell
  export RETRIEVERS_0_KIND=github
  ```

:::info
If you want to avoid any collision with existing environment variables that are not specifically related to the relay proxy, you can prefix your environment variables.

You can configure the prefix using the [`envVariablePrefix`](#envvariableprefix) field in your configuration file.

## Configuration Options
### `retrievers`
This is the configuration on how to retrieve the configuration of the files.
- option name: `retrievers`
- type: [`[]retriever`](#type-retriever)
- default: **none**
- **mandatory: <Mandatory />**
- You can have multiple retrievers at the same time, check [_"Using multiple retrievers"_](../concepts/retriever#using-multiple-retrievers) to see how it works.
- Configuration of a retriever depends on the one you are choosing. Check the [list of retrievers](../integrations/store-flags-configuration#available-retrievers) and go on the detail page of your choice to configure it.

```yaml title="example goff-proxy.yaml"
retrievers:
  - kind: file
    path: /goff/my-flags.yaml
  - kind: s3
    bucket: my-featureflag-bucket
    item: flag/flags.goff.yaml
```

### `startWithRetrieverError`
By default, the **relay proxy** will crash if it is not able to retrieve the flags from the configuration.

If you don't want your relay proxy to crash, you can set `startWithRetrieverError` to true. Until the flag is retrievable the relay proxy will only answer with default values.
- option name: `startWithRetrieverError`
- type: **boolean**
- default: **`false`**
- mandatory: <NotMandatory />

### `persistentFlagConfigurationFile`
If set, GO Feature Flag will store the flags configuration in this file to be able to serve the flags even if none of the retrievers is available during starting time.
:::info
By default, the flag configuration is not persisted and stays on the retriever system. By setting a file here, you ensure that GO Feature Flag will always start with a configuration but which can be out-dated.
:::
- option name: `persistentFlagConfigurationFile`
- type: **string**

- The minimum time accepted is 1000 millisecond (1 second).
- If you set a negative value, the polling will be disabled.
- mandatory: <NotMandatory />

### `enablePollingJitter`
Set to true if you want to avoid having true periodicity when retrieving your flags. It is useful to avoid having spike on your flag configuration storage in case your application is starting multiple instance at the same time.

## Configuration Types

### type `authorizedKeys`
`authorizedKeys` is an object were it is possible to configure the list of API Keys that are accepted by the relay proxy.

#### `authorizedKeys.evaluation`
If set, we will check for each evaluation if an authorized key is provided.

Each request will need to provide one of authorized key inside `Authorization` header with format `Bearer <api-key>`.
- option name: `evaluation`
- type: **[]string**
- default: **none**
- mandatory: <NotMandatory />

#### `authorizedKeys.admin`

Each request will need to provide one of authorized key inside `Authorization` header with format `Bearer <api-key>`.
- option name: `evaluation`
- type: **[]string**
- default: **none**
- mandatory: <NotMandatory />
- If no api key is configured the endpoint will be unreachable.

#### Example
```yaml title="goff-proxy.yaml"
# ...
authorizedKeys:
  evaluation:
    - "my-first-key"
    - "my-second-key"
  admin:
    - "my-first-admin-key"
    - "my-second-admin-key"
```

### type `retriever`
A [retriever](../concepts/retriever) is the component in charge of loading your flag configuration from a remote source.

#### `retriever.kind`
Configuring a retriever always start by setting the kind of retriever you want to use. This is the only common param between all the retrievers.

- option name: `kind`
- type: **string**
- default: **none**
- mandatory: <Mandatory />

:::info
To find the **`kind`** to use for your retriever and the **rest of the options**, check the [list of retrievers](../integrations/store-flags-configuration#available-retrievers) and go on the detail page of your choice to configure it.

**Available retrievers**:
<ul>
{ getIntegrations("v1.45.0").retrievers.filter(r => r.docLink !== undefined).map((r) => (
  <li key={r.name}><a href={`../integrations/store-flags-configuration/${r.docLink}`}>{r.name}</a></li>
)) }
</ul>
:::

### type `exporter`

    flushInterval: 10000
```
:::info
Every `exporter` has its own configuration, check the [list of exporters](../integrations/export-evaluation-data#available-exporters) and go on the detail page of your choice to configure it.

**Available exporters**:
<ul>
  { getIntegrations("v1.45.0").exporters.filter(r => r.docLink !== undefined).map((r) => (
