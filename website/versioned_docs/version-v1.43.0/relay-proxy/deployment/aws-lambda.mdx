# AWS Lambda

## Overview
The GO Feature Flag relay proxy can easily be launched as an AWS Lambda function.

## How to start the relay proxy as an AWS Lambda function

To start GO Feature Flag relay-proxy as a lambda you have to set the option `startAsAwsLambda` in your configuration file to `true`, 
and you have to set which lambda handler you want to use, by setting the option `awsLambdaAdapter`.

```yaml title="goff-proxy.yaml"
# ...
startAsAwsLambda: true
awsLambdaAdapter: APIGatewayV2
# ...
```

| Field name           |    Mandatory     | Type      | Default            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|----------------------|:----------------:|-----------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **startAsAwsLambda** |  <Mandatory />   | `boolean` | **`false`**        | Set to `true` if you want to start the GO Feature Flag relay proxy as an AWS Lambda                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **awsLambdaAdapter** | <NotMandatory /> | `string`  | **`APIGatewayV2`** | <p>This param is used only if `startAsAwsLambda` is true.</p><p>This parameter allow you to decide which type of AWS lambda handler you wan to use.</p><p>Accepted values are:<ul><li>`APIGatewayV2`</li><li>`APIGatewayV1`</li><li>`ALB`</li></ul></p> |


Once you've updated your configuration file, you can deploy your function in AWS and configure it to be accessible
via HTTP. This can be achieved by creating an API Gateway or an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and linking it to
your Lambda function.

By configuring your GO Feature Flag relay proxy to run as an AWS Lambda function, you can take advantage of many
benefits of serverless computing, including automatic scaling, reduced infrastructure costs, and simplified
deployment and management.

## Lambda Binary

As part of our release process, we are building an archive ready to be deployed as AWS lambda.

You can find it in the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/releases),and you can use the assets named `go-feature-flag-aws-lambda_<version>.zip`.
