          ContextKind is the kind of context which generated an event. This will only be "anonymousUser" for events generated

      default:
        description: |-
          Default value is set to true if feature flag evaluation failed, in which case the value returned was the default

        description: |-
          Kind for a feature event is feature.
          A feature event will only be generated if the trackEvents attribute of the flag is set to true.
        example: feature
        type: string
      source:
        description: |-
          Source indicates where the event was generated.
          This is set to SERVER when the event was evaluated in the relay-proxy and PROVIDER_CACHE when it is evaluated from the cache.
        example: SERVER

          UserKey The key of the user object used in a feature flag evaluation. Details for the user object used in a feature
          flag evaluation as reported by the "feature" event are transmitted periodically with a separate index event.
        example: 94a25909-20d8-40cc-8500-fee99b569345
        type: string
      value:
        description: Value of the feature flag returned by feature flag evaluation.
      variation:
        description: |-
          Variation  of the flag requested. Flag variation values can be "True", "False", "Default" or "SdkDefault"
          depending on which value was taken during flag evaluation. "SdkDefault" is used when an error is detected and the
          default value passed during the call to your variation is used.
        example: admin-variation
        type: string
      version:
        description: |-
          Version contains the version of the flag. If the field is omitted for the flag in the configuration file

        This endpoint is receiving the events of your flags usage to send them in the data collector.

        It is used by the different Open Feature providers to send in bulk all the cached events to avoid
        to lose track of what happen when a cached flag is used.

        Making a **POST** request to the URL `/v1/feature/<your_flag_name>/eval` will give you the value of the
        flag for this user.

        To get a variation you should provide information about the user:
        - User information in JSON in the request body.
        - A default value in case there is an error while evaluating the flag.

        Note that you will always have a usable value in the response, you can use the field `failed` to know if
        an issue has occurred during the validation of the flag, in that case the value returned will be the
        default value.
