# Canary Release

**Canary release** is a technique to reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by slowly rolling out the change to a small subset of users before rolling it out to the entire infrastructure and making it available to everybody.

This is the easiest rollout strategy available.  
You just have to select a percentage of your users in your flag, and the `True` behavior will apply to them.

## Example

=== "YAML"

    ``` yaml linenums="1" hl_lines="5"
    canary-flag:
      true: true
      false: false
      default: false
      percentage: 1
    ```

=== "JSON"

    ``` json linenums="1" hl_lines="6"
    {
      "canary-flag": {
        "true": true,
        "false": false,
        "default": "false,
        "percentage": 1
      }
    }
    ```

=== "TOML"

    ``` toml linenums="1" hl_lines="5"
    [canary-flag]
    true = true
    false = false
    default = false
    percentage = 1.0
    ```
