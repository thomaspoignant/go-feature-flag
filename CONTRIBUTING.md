## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Setup
We always thrive to keep the project as simple as possible, so you will find everything you need in the `Makefile` at the root of the repository.

To start contributing please set up your GO environment and run: 

```shell
make vendor
```
It will download the dependencies and your project will be ready to be used.

### Coding standards

It is easier for contributors to work on the same project if it has a consistent, unified style, approach, and layout.

To help with that, we are using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to lint before each commit, I would recommend you to install it, and to apply it to the project by running:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Tests
Every feature or bug should come with an associate test to keep the coverage as high as possible.
We aim to have 90% of coverage for the project.

## üìö Documentation

We are maintaining 2 documentations:
- [README.md](README.md) which contains everything you need to know to start working with the module.
- [go-feature-flag website](https://gofeatureflag.org) which is the full detail website containing the documentation.

If your contribution has impact on the documentation, please check both version. You can check how to work on the documentation [here](./website/README.md).

### How to run the documentation website locally

For the documentation website we are using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).  
Everything is available in the [`website/docs`](website/docs) directory.

Your can start locally the website.

1. Open a terminal and go to the root project of this repository.
2. Launch the command bellow, it will install the dependencies and run the local server for the documentation.
```shell
make watch-doc
```
3. You can now access to the documentation directly in your browser: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
